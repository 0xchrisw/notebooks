NAME
       db5.3_stat - Display statistics for Berkeley DB environments

SYNOPSIS
       db5.3_stat -d file [-fN] [-h home] [-P password] [-s database]

       db5.3_stat [-cEelmNrtVZ] [-C Aclop] [-h home] [-L A] [-M A] [-R A] [-P
       password]

DESCRIPTION
       The db5.3_stat utility displays statistics for Berkeley DB
       environments.

OPTIONS
       -C     Display internal information about the locking subsystem.  (The
	      output from this option is often both voluminous and
	      meaningless, and is intended only for debugging.)

	      A      Display all information.

	      c      Display lock conflict matrix.

	      l      Display lockers within hash chains.

	      o      Display lock objects within hash chains.

	      p      Display locking subsystem parameters.

       -c     Display locking subsystem statistics, as described in
	      DB_ENV->lock_stat.

       -d     Display database statistics for the specified file, as described
	      in DB->stat.

	      If the database contains multiple databases and the -s flag is
	      not specified, the statistics are for the internal database that
	      describes the other databases the file contains, and not for the
	      file as a whole.

       -E     Display internal information about the database environment,
	      including all configured subsystems of the database environment.
	      (The output from this option is often both voluminous and
	      meaningless, and is intended only for debugging.)

       -e     Display information about the database environment, including
	      all configured subsystems of the database environment.

       -f     Display only those database statistics that can be acquired
	      without traversing the database.

       -h     Specify a home directory for the database environment; by
	      default, the current working directory is used.

       -l     Display logging subsystem statistics, as described in
	      DB_ENV->log_stat.

       -M     Display internal information about the cache.  (The output from
	      this option is often both voluminous and meaningless, and is
	      intended only for debugging.)

	      A      Display all information.

	      h      Display buffers within hash chains.

       -m     Display cache statistics, as described in DB_ENV->memp_stat.

       -N     Do not acquire shared region mutexes while running.  Other
	      problems, such as potentially fatal errors in Berkeley DB, will
	      be ignored as well.  This option is intended only for debugging
	      errors, and should not be used under any other circumstances.

       -P     Specify an environment password.	Although Berkeley DB utilities
	      overwrite password strings as soon as possible, be aware there
	      may be a window of vulnerability on systems where unprivileged
	      users can see command-line arguments or where utilities are not
	      able to overwrite the memory containing the command-line
	      arguments.

       -R     Display internal information about the replication subsystem.
	      (The output from this option is often both voluminous and
	      meaningless, and is intended only for debugging.)

	      A      Display all information.

       -r     Display replication statistics, as described in
	      DB_ENV->rep_stat.

       -s     Display statistics for the specified database contained in the
	      file specified with the -d flag.

       -t     Display transaction subsystem statistics, as described in
	      DB_ENV->txn_stat.

       -V     Write the library version number to the standard output, and
	      exit.

       -Z     Reset the statistics after reporting them; valid only with the
	      -C, -c, -E, -e, -L, -l, -M, -m, -R, -r, and -t options.

       Values normally displayed in quantities of bytes are displayed as a
       combination of gigabytes (GB), megabytes (MB), kilobytes (KB), and
       bytes (B).  Otherwise, values smaller than 10 million are displayed
       without any special notation, and values larger than 10 million are
       displayed as a number followed by "M".

       The db5.3_stat utility may be used with a Berkeley DB environment (as
       described for the -h option, the environment variable DB_HOME, or
       because the utility was run in a directory containing a Berkeley DB
       environment).  In order to avoid environment corruption when using a
       Berkeley DB environment, db5.3_stat should always be given the chance
       to detach from the environment and exit gracefully.  To cause
       db5.3_stat to release all environment resources and exit cleanly, send
       it an interrupt signal (SIGINT).

       The db5.3_stat utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

ENVIRONMENT
       DB_HOME
	      If the -h option is not specified and the environment variable
	      DB_HOME is set, it is used as the path of the database home, as
	      described in DB_ENV->open.
