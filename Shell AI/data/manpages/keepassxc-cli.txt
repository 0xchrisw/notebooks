NAME
       keepassxc-cli - command line interface for the KeePassXC password
       manager.

SYNOPSIS
       keepassxc-cli command [options]

DESCRIPTION
       keepassxc-cli is the command line interface for the KeePassXC password
       manager. It provides the ability to query and modify the entries of a
       KeePass database, directly from the command line.

COMMANDS
       add [options] <database> <entry>
	      Adds a new entry to a database. A password can be generated (-g
	      option), or a prompt can be displayed to input the password (-p
	      option).

       clip [options] <database> <entry> [timeout]
	      Copies the password or the current TOTP (-t option) of a
	      database entry to the clipboard. If multiple entries with the
	      same name exist in different groups, only the password for the
	      first one is going to be copied. For copying the password of an
	      entry in a specific group, the group path to the entry should be
	      specified as well, instead of just the name. Optionally, a
	      timeout in seconds can be specified to automatically clear the
	      clipboard.

       create [options] <database>
	      Creates a new database with a key file and/or password. The key
	      file will be created if the file that is referred to does not
	      exist. If both the key file and password are empty, no database
	      will be created.

       diceware [options]
	      Generate a random diceware passphrase.

       edit [options] <database> <entry>
	      Edits a database entry. A password can be generated (-g option),
	      or a prompt can be displayed to input the password (-p option).

       estimate [options] [password]
	      Estimates the entropy of a password. The password to estimate
	      can be provided as a positional argument, or using the standard
	      input.

       extract [options] <database>
	      Extracts and prints the contents of a database to standard
	      output in XML format.

       generate [options]
	      Generate a random password.

       locate [options] <database> <term>
	      Locates all the entries that match a specific search term in a
	      database.

       ls [options] <database> [group]
	      Lists the contents of a group in a database. If no group is
	      specified, it will default to the root group.

       merge [options] <database1> <database2>
	      Merges two databases together. The first database file is going
	      to be replaced by the result of the merge, for that reason it is
	      advisable to keep a backup of the two database files before
	      attempting a merge. In the case that both databases make use of
	      the same credentials, the --same-credentials or -s option can be
	      used.

       rm [options] <database> <entry>
	      Removes an entry from a database. If the database has a recycle
	      bin, the entry will be moved there. If the entry is already in
	      the recycle bin, it will be removed permanently.

       show [options] <database> <entry>
	      Shows the title, username, password, URL and notes of a database
	      entry. Can also show the current TOTP. Regarding the occurrence
	      of multiple entries with the same name in different groups,
	      everything stated in the clip command section also applies here.
