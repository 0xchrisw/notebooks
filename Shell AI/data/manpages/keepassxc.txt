       keepassxc [files/filelist]

DESCRIPTION
       KeePassX is a free/open-source password manager or safe which helps you
       to manage your passwords in a secure way. You can put all your
       passwords in one database, which is locked with one master key or a
       key-disk. So you only have to remember one single master password or
       insert the key-disk to unlock the whole database. The databases are
       encrypted using the best and most secure encryption algorithms
       currently known (AES and Twofish).
