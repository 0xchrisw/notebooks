NAME
       virt-sanlock-cleanup - remove stale sanlock resource lease files

SYNOPSIS
       virt-sanlock-cleanup

DESCRIPTION
       This tool removes any resource lease files created by the sanlock lock
       manager plugin. The resource lease files only need to exist on disks
       when a guest using the resource is active. This script reclaims the
       disk space used by resources which are not currently active.

EXIT STATUS
       Upon successful processing of leases cleanup, an exit status of 0 will
       be set. Upon fatal error a non-zero status will be set.
