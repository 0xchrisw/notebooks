NAME
       bogolexer - Utility program for separating email messages into tokens

SYNOPSIS
       bogolexer [-p] [-q] [-h] [-n] [-v] [-x flags] [-c file] [-C] [-D]
		 [-I file] [-O file] [-V]

DESCRIPTION
       Bogolexer is part of the bogofilter Bayesian spam filter package.

       It is used to separate messages into tokens and to test new versions of
       the lexer.l code.

OPTIONS
       The -p option tells bogolexer to print just the tokens read from stdin,
       without any extra messages.

       The -q option tells bogolexer to print a token count, without printing
       the actual tokens.

       The -h option prints the help message and exits.

       The -n option tells bogolexer to map non-ascii characters to the
       question point '?'.

       The -v option increases the verbosity level.

       The -x flags option allows setting of debug flags for printing debug
       messages.

       The -cfilename option tells bogolexer to read the config file named.

       The -C option prevents bogolexer from reading configuration files.

       The -D option redirects the debugging output to stdout (it defaults to
       stderr).

       The -I filename option tells bogolexer to read its input from the
       specified file, rather than from stdin.

       The -O filename option tells bogolexer to write its output to the
       specified file, rather than to stdout.

       The -V option prints the version number and exits.
