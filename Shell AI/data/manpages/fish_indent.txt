NAME
       fish_indent - indenter and prettifier

SYNOPSIS
	  fish_indent [OPTIONS] [FILE...]

DESCRIPTION
       fish_indent is used to indent a piece of fish code. fish_indent reads
       commands from standard input or the given filenames and outputs them to
       standard output or a specified file (if -w is given).

       The following options are available:

       • -w or --write indents a specified file and immediately writes to that
	 file.

       • -i or --no-indent do not indent commands; only reformat to one job
	 per line.

       • -v or --version displays the current fish version and then exits.

       • --ansi colorizes the output using ANSI escape sequences, appropriate
	 for the current $TERM, using the colors defined in the environment
	 (such as $fish_color_command).

       • --html outputs HTML, which supports syntax highlighting if the
	 appropriate CSS is defined. The CSS class names are the same as the
	 variable names, such as fish_color_command.

       • -d or --debug=CATEGORY_GLOB enables debug output and specifies a glob
	 for matching debug categories (like fish -d). Defaults to empty.

       • -D or --debug-stack-frames=DEBUG_LEVEL specify how many stack frames
	 to display when debug messages are written. The default is zero. A
	 value of 3 or 4 is usually sufficient to gain insight into how a
	 given debug call was reached but you can specify a value up to 128.

       • --dump-parse-tree dumps information about the parsed statements to
	 stderr. This is likely to be of interest only to people working on
	 the fish source code.
