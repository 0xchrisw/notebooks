NAME
       opensc-tool - generic smart card utility

SYNOPSIS
       opensc-tool [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
       The opensc-tool utility can be used from the command line to perform
       miscellaneous smart card operations such as getting the card ATR or
       sending arbitrary APDU commands to a card.

OPTIONS
       --version,
	   Print the OpenSC package release version.

       --atr, -a
	   Print the Answer To Reset (ATR) of the card. Output is in hex byte
	   format

       --card-driver driver, -c driver
	   Use the given card driver. The default is auto-detected.

       --list-algorithms,
	   Lists algorithms supported by card

       --info, -i
	   Print information about OpenSC, such as version and enabled
	   components.

       --list-drivers, -D
	   List all installed card drivers.

       --list-files, -f
	   Recursively list all files stored on card.

       --list-readers, -l
	   List all configured readers.

       --name, -n
	   Print the name of the inserted card (driver).

       --get-conf-entry conf, -G conf
	   Get configuration key, format: section:name:key

       --set-conf-entry conf, -S conf
	   Set configuration key, format: section:name:key:value

       --reader arg, -r arg
	   Number of the reader to use. By default, the first reader with a
	   present card is used. If arg is an ATR, the reader with a matching
	   card will be chosen.

       --reset [type],
	   Resets the card in reader. The default reset type is cold, but warm
	   reset is also possible.

       --send-apdu apdu, -s apdu
	   Sends an arbitrary APDU to the card in the format
	   AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF....

       --serial
	   Print the card serial number (normally the ICCSN). Output is in hex
	   byte format

       --verbose, -v
	   Causes opensc-tool to be more verbose. Specify this flag several
	   times to enable debug output in the opensc library.

       --wait, -w
	   Wait for a card to be inserted.
