NAME
       fsck.zfs - Dummy ZFS filesystem checker.

SYNOPSIS
       fsck.zfs [options] <dataset>

DESCRIPTION
       fsck.zfs is a shell stub that does nothing and always returns true. It
       is installed by ZoL because some Linux distributions expect a fsck
       helper for all filesystems.

OPTIONS
       All options and the dataset are ignored.

NOTES
       ZFS datasets are checked by running zpool scrub on the containing pool.
       An individual ZFS dataset is never checked independently of its pool,
       which is unlike a regular filesystem.

BUGS
       On some systems, if the dataset is in a degraded pool, then it might be
       appropriate for fsck.zfs to return exit code 4 to indicate an
       uncorrected filesystem error.

       Similarly, if the dataset is in a faulted pool and has a legacy
       /etc/fstab record, then fsck.zfs should return exit code 8 to indicate
       a fatal operational error.
