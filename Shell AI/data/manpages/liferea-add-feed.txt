NAME
       Liferea - GTK desktop news aggregator

SYNOPSIS
       liferea [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
       Liferea (Linux Feed Reader) is an aggregator for online news feeds.  It
       can be used to maintain a list of subscribed feeds, browse and search
       through their items and displays their contents.  Additionally Liferea
       allows one to sync subscriptions and read headlines with online
       accounts of TinyTinyRSS and TheOldReader.

       Liferea options:

       -v, --version

       -a, --add-feed=URI
	      Add a new subscription URI which can be a feed or website URL

       -w, --mainwindow-state=STATE
	      Start Liferea with its mainwindow in STATE: shown, iconified,
	      hidden

DBUS INTERFACE
       To allow integration with other programs Liferea profives a DBUS
       interface for automatic creation of new subscriptions. The script
       liferea-add-feed is a convenient way to use this interface. Just pass a
       valid feed URL as parameter and the feed will be added to the feed
       list. You can also pass non-feed URLs to use feed auto discovery.
       Example:

       liferea-add-feed "http://www.newsforge.com/newsforge.rss"

       Please note that Liferea needs to be running for liferea-add-feed to
       work.

ENVIRONMENT
       http_proxy
	      If a proxy is not specified in the Liferea preferences (which
	      uses the proxy settings provided by dconf), then Liferea will
	      use the proxy specified in $http_proxy.  $http_proxy should be
	      set to a URI specifying the desired proxy, for example
	      ‘http://proxy.example.com:3128/’.

FILES
       $XDG_CONFIG_DIR/liferea/feedlist.opml
	      Contains the current list of subscriptions

       $XDG_CONFIG_DIR/liferea/liferea.css
	      Stylesheet that can be used to override default HTML style

       $XDG_DATA_DIR/liferea/liferea.db
	      Sqlite3 database with all subscriptions and headlines
