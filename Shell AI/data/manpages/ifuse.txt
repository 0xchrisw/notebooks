NAME
       ifuse - Mount directories of an iOS device locally using fuse.

SYNOPSIS
       ifuse MOUNTPOINT [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
       Mount directories of an iOS device locally using fuse. By default the
       media directory is mounted, options allow to also mount the sandbox
       container of an app, an app's documents folder or even the root
       filesystem on jailbroken devices.

       Example:

       $ ifuse /media/iPhone --root

       This mounts the root filesystem of the first attached device on this
       computer in the directory /media/iPhone.

       Regular users are able to unmount fuse mounts using "fusermount -u
       MOUNTPOINT".
