NAME
       bf_compact - shell script to compact a bogofilter directory

SYNOPSIS
       bf_compact bogofilter_directory [wordlist_name...]

DESCRIPTION
       bf_compact creates a more compact bogofilter working directory with a
       dump/load cycle and renames the previous bogofilter_directory to
       bogofilter_directory.old.

       Note: bf_compact cannot be used to process the current working
       directory, ".", because that cannot be renamed.

       If no wordlist_file arguments are given, then bf_compact will use the
       configured set of wordlists, if the given bogofilter_directory is the
       same as the configured, or use all *.db files if it is a different
       directory.

EXIT STATUS
       The script exits with status code 0 if everything went well, and
       nonzero if it encountered trouble.

NOTES
       This script will delete bogofilter_directory.old and all of its
       contents!

       This script expects a SUSv2 compliant shell. Solaris systems should
       have the SUNWxcu4 package installed (when bogofilter is configured) so
       that /usr/xpg4/bin/sh can be used.
