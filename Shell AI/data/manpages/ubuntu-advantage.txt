NAME
       ubuntu-advantage - Manage Ubuntu Advantage services from Canonical

SYNOPSIS
       ua <command> [<args>]
       ubuntu-advantage <command> [<args>]

DESCRIPTION
       Ubuntu Advantage is a collection of services offered by Canonical to
       Ubuntu users. The Ubuntu Advantage command line tool is used to attach
       a system to an Ubuntu Advantage contract to then enable and disable
       services from Canonical. The available commands and services are
       described in more detail below.

COMMANDS
       attach [--no-auto-enable] [--attach-config=/path/to/file.yaml] <token>
	      Connect an Ubuntu Advantage support contract to this machine.

	      The token parameter can be obtained from
	      https://auth.contracts.canonical.com/.

	      The --attach-config option can be used to provide a file with
	      the token and optionally, a list of services to enable after
	      attaching. The token parameter should not be used if this option
	      is provided. An attach config file looks like the following:
		  token: YOUR_TOKEN_HERE  # required
		  enable_services:	  # optional list of service names to
	      auto-enable
		      - esm-infra
		      - esm-apps
		      - cis

	      The optional --no-auto-enable flag will disable the automatic
	      enablement of recommended entitlements which usually happens
	      immediately after a successful attach.

	      The exit code can be:
		  0: on successful attach
		  1: in case of any error while trying to attach
		  2: if the machine is already attached

       collect-logs [-o <file>| --output <file>]
	      Create a tarball with all relevant UA logs and debug data.

	      The --output parameter defines the path to the tarball. If not
	      provided, the file is saved as ua_logs.tar.gz in the current
	      directory.

       detach Remove the Ubuntu Advantage support contract from this machine.
	      This also disables all enabled services that can be.

       disable [cc-eal|cis|esm|fips|fips-updates|livepatch|ros|ros-updates]
	      Disable this machine's access to an Ubuntu Advantage service.

       enable [cc-eal|cis|esm|fips|fips-updates|livepatch|ros|ros-updates]
	      Activate and configure this machine's access to an Ubuntu
	      Advantage service.

       fix <security_issue>
	      Fix a CVE or USN on the system by upgrading the appropriate
	      package(s).

	      <security_issue> can be any of the following formats: CVE-yyyy-
	      nnnn, CVE-yyyy-nnnnnnn, or USN-nnnn-dd.

	      The exit code can be 0, 1, or 2.
		  0: the fix was successfully applied
		  1: the fix cannot be applied
		  2: the fix was applied but requires a reboot before it takes
	      effect

       refresh
	      Refresh contract and service details from Canonical.

       security-status
	      Show security updates for packages in the system, including all
	      available ESM related content.

       status [--format=tabular|json|yaml] [--simulate-with-token TOKEN]
       [--all]
	      Report current status of Ubuntu Advantage services on system.

	      This shows whether this machine is attached to an Ubuntu
	      Advantage support contract. When attached, the report includes
	      the specific support contract details including contract name,
	      expiry dates, and the status of each service on this system.

	      The attached status output has four columns:

	      SERVICE: name of the service

	      ENTITLED: whether the contract to which this machine is attached
	      entitles use of this service. Possible values are: yes or no

	      STATUS: whether the service is enabled on this machine.
	      Possible values are: enabled, disabled, n/a (if your contract
	      entitles you to the service, but it isn't available for this
	      machine) or â€” (if you aren't entitled to this service)

	      DESCRIPTION: a brief description of the service

	      The unattached status output instead has three columns. SERVICE
	      and DESCRIPTION are the same as above, and there is the addition
	      of:

	      AVAILABLE: whether this service would be available if this
	      machine were attached.  The possible values are yes or no.

	      If --simulate-with-token is used, then the output has five
	      columns.	SERVICE, AVAILABLE, ENTITLED and DESCRIPTION are the
	      same as mentioned above, and AUTO_ENABLED shows whether the
	      service is set to be enabled when that token is attached.

	      If the --all flag is set, beta and unavailable services are also
	      listed in the output.

       version
	      Show version of the Ubuntu Advantage package.

PRO UPGRADE DAEMON
       UA client sets up a daemon on supported platforms (currently GCP only)
       to detect if an Ubuntu Pro license is purchased for the machine. If a
       Pro license is detected, then the machine is automatically attached.
       If you are uninterested in UA services, you can safely stop and disable
       the daemon using systemctl:

       sudo systemctl stop ubuntu-advantage.service sudo systemctl disable
       ubuntu-advantage.service

TIMER JOBS
       UA client sets up a systemd timer to run jobs that need to be executed
       recurrently. The timer itself ticks every 5 minutes on average, and
       decides which jobs need to be executed based on their intervals.

       Jobs are executed by the timer script if the script has not yet run
       successfully, or their interval since last successful run is already
       exceeded.  There is a random delay applied to the timer, to
       desynchronize job execution time on machines spinned at the same time,
       avoiding multiple synchronized calls to the same service.

       Current jobs being checked and executed are:

       update_messaging
	      Makes sure that the MOTD and APT messages match the
	      available/enabled services on the system, showing information
	      about available packages or security updates.

       update_status
	      Makes sure the `ua status` command will have the latest
	      information even when executed by a non-root user, updating the
	      /var/lib/ubuntu-advantage/status.json file.

CONFIGURATION
       By default, Ubuntu Advantage client configuration options are read from
       /etc/ubuntu-advantage/uaclient.conf.

       The following configuration options are available:

       contract_url
	      The ubuntu advantage contract server URL

       security_url
	      The ubuntu advantage security server URL

       data_dir
	      Where Ubuntu Advantage client stores its data files

       log_level
	      The logging level used when writing to log_file

       log_file
	      The log file for the Ubuntu Advantage client

       timer_log_file
	      The log file for the Ubuntu Advantage timer and timer jobs

       daemon_log_file
	      The log file for the Ubuntu Advantage daemon

       The following options must be nested under the "ua_config" key:

       http_proxy
	      If set, ua will use the specified http proxy when making any
	      http requests

       https_proxy
	      If set, ua will use the specified https proxy when making any
	      https requests

       apt_http_proxy
	      If set, ua will configure apt to use the specified http proxy by
	      writing a apt config file to /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/90ubuntu-
	      advantage-aptproxy

       apt_https_proxy
	      If set, ua will configure apt to use the specified https proxy
	      by writing a apt config file to /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/90ubuntu-
	      advantage-aptproxy

       <job_name>_timer
	      Sets the timer running interval for a specific job. Those
	      intervals are checked every time the systemd timer runs.

       If needed, authentication to the proxy server can be performed by
       setting username and password in the URL itself, as in:

	 http_proxy: http://<username>:<password>@<fqdn>:<port>

       Additionally, some configuration options can be overridden in the
       environment by setting an environment variable prefaced by
       UA_<option_name>. Both uppercase and lowercase environment variables
       are allowed. The configuration options that support this are: data_dir,
       log_file, timer_log_file, daemon_log_file, log_level, and security_url.

       For example, the following overrides the log_level found in
       uaclient.conf:

	 UA_LOG_LEVEL=info ua attach

SERVICES
       Common Criteria EAL2 Provisioning (cc-eal)
	      Enables and install the Common Criteria artifacts.

	      The artifacts include a configure script, a tarball with
	      additional packages, and post install scripts. The artifacts
	      will be installed in /usr/lib/common-criteria directory and the
	      README and configuration guide are available in
	      /usr/share/doc/ubuntu-commoncriteria directory.

       CIS Audit (cis)
	      Enables and installs the CIS Audit artifacts.

       Extended Security Maintenance (esm)
	      Extended Security Maintenance ensures the ongoing security and
	      integrity of systems running Ubuntu Long Term Support (LTS)
	      releases through Ubuntu Advantage for Infrastructure.

	      See https://ubuntu.com/esm for more information.

       FIPS 140-2 certified modules (fips)
	      Install, configure, and enable FIPS 140-2 certified modules.

	      After successfully enabling FIPS, the system MUST be rebooted.
	      Failing to reboot will result in the system not running the
	      updated FIPS kernel.

	      Disabling FIPS is not currently supported.

       FIPS 140-2 certified modules with updates (fips-updates)
	      Install, configure, and enable FIPS 140-2 certified modules with
	      updates. Enabling FIPS with updates will take the system out of
	      FIPS compliance as the updated modules are not FIPS certified.

	      After successfully enabling FIPS with updates, the system MUST
	      be rebooted. Failing to reboot will result in the system not
	      running the updated FIPS kernel.

	      Disabling FIPS with updates is not currently supported.

       Livepatch Service (livepatch)
	      Automatically apply critical kernel patches without rebooting.
	      Reduces downtime, keeping your Ubuntu LTS systems secure and
