ZVOL_WAIT(1)		    System Manager's Manual		  ZVOL_WAIT(1)

NAME
     zvol_wait â€” Wait for ZFS volume links in /dev to be created.

SYNOPSIS
     zvol_wait

DESCRIPTION
     When a ZFS pool is imported, ZFS will register each ZFS volume (zvol) as
     a disk device with the system. As the disks are registered, udev(7) will
     asynchronously create symlinks under /dev/zvol using the zvol's name.
     zvol_wait will wait for all those symlinks to be created before
     returning.
