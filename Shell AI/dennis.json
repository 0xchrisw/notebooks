When plugged in for the first\ntime, they act like a flash storage and start installing the Windows\ndriver from there. If the driver is installed, it makes the storage\ndevice disappear and a new device, mainly composite (e.g. with modem\nports), shows up.\n\nOn Linux, in most cases the drivers are available as kernel modules,\nsuch as \"usbserial\" or \"option\". However, the device initially binds to\n\"usb-storage\" by default. usb_modeswitch can then send a provided bulk\nmessage (most likely a mass storage command) to the device; this\nmessage has to be determined by analyzing the actions of the Windows\ndriver.\n\nIn some cases, USB control commands are used for switching. These cases\nare handled by custom functions, and no bulk message needs to be\nprovided.\n\nUsually, the program is distributed with a set of configurations for\nmany known devices, which allows a fully automatic handling of a device\nupon insertion, made possible by combining usb_modeswitch with the\nwrapper script usb_modeswitch_dispatcher which is launched by the udev\ndaemon. This requires a Linux-flavoured system though.\n\nNote that usb_modeswitch itself has no specific Linux dependencies."

Among these are the\nusage (or help) screen, the listing and diagnostic functions (-l and\n-v), the ability to decompress older compression formats (the\n``reduce,'' ``shrink'' and ``implode'' methods).  The ability to\nextract to a directory other than the current one can be selected as a\ncompile-time option, which is now enabled by default since UnZipSFX\nversion 5.5.  Similarly, decryption is supported as a compile-time\noption but should be avoided unless the attached archive contains\nencrypted files. Starting with release 5.5, another compile-time option\nadds a simple ``run command after extraction'' feature.\tThis feature\nis currently incompatible with the ``extract to different directory''\nfeature and remains disabled by default.\n\nNote that self-extracting archives made with unzipsfx are no more (or\nless) portable across different operating systems than is the unzip\nexecutable itself.  In general a self-extracting archive made on a\nparticular Unix system, for example, will only self-extract under the\nsame flavor of Unix.  Regular unzip may still be used to extract the\nembedded archive as with any normal zipfile, although it will generate\na harmless warning about extra bytes at the beginning of the zipfile.\nDespite this, however, the self-extracting archive is technically not a\nvalid ZIP archive, and PKUNZIP may be unable to test or extract it.\nThis limitation is due to the simplistic manner in which the archive is\ncreated; the internal directory structure is not updated to reflect the\nextra bytes prepended to the original zipfile."

To repair with no metadata\nareas, use --settings \"mda_offset=0 mda_size=0\".\n\nThere are cases where repair should be run on all PVs in the VG (using\nthe same metadata file):  if all PVs in the VG are damaged, if using an\nold metadata version, or if a backup file is used instead of raw\nmetadata.\n\nUsing --repair is equivalent to running --repairtype pv_header followed\nby --repairtype metadata.\n\n--repairtype pv_header\nRepairs the header sector, containing the pv_header and label_header.\n\n--repairtype metadata\nRepairs the mda_header and metadata text.  It requires the headers to\nbe correct (having been undamaged or already repaired).\n\n--repairtype label_header\nRepairs label_header fields, leaving the pv_header (in the same sector)\nunchanged.

Each set of rules is called a chain.  Each chain is an ordered\nlist of rules that can match ARP frames. If a rule matches an ARP\nframe, then a processing specification tells what to do with that\nmatching frame. The processing specification is called a 'target'.\nHowever, if the frame does not match the current rule in the chain,\nthen the next rule in the chain is examined and so forth.  The user can\ncreate new (user-defined) chains which can be used as the 'target' of a\nrule.\n\nTARGETS\nA firewall rule specifies criteria for an ARP frame and a frame\nprocessing specification called a target.  When a frame matches a rule,\nthen the next action performed by the kernel is specified by the\ntarget.\tThe target can be one of these values: ACCEPT, DROP, CONTINUE,\nRETURN, an 'extension' (see below) or a user-defined chain.\n\nACCEPT means to let the frame through.  DROP means the frame has to be\ndropped.  CONTINUE means the next rule has to be checked. This can be\nhandy to know how many frames pass a certain point in the chain or to\nlog those frames.  RETURN means stop traversing this chain and resume\nat the next rule in the previous (calling) chain.  For the extension\ntargets please see the TARGET EXTENSIONS section of this man page.\n\nTABLES\nThere is only one ARP table in the Linux kernel.  The table is filter.\nYou can drop the '-t filter' argument to the arptables command.\tThe -t\nargument must be the first argument on the arptables command line, if\nused.\n"

After you\nmake a choice for the input method, this displays a guidance for\nassociated packages to be installed.\n\nIf only a set of required input method packages along with the\nim-config package is installed, you do not need to use this command.\nSuch a installation works well in its default and there is no need to\nuse this command.  When you wish to have multiple input method\nenvironments installed and wish to switch among them, you need to use\nthis command.\n\nIf you have no idea for what package to install, im-config invoked with\nboth -a and -s is a good start.\n\nThis input method is the essential mechanism for Japanese, Chinese and\nKorean (CJK) languages to enter their non-ASCII native characters.\nThis is also useful to support specialized keyboard bindings for other\nnon-European languages such as Indic and other Asian languages.\n\nSome input methods such as IBus, fcitx, and uim support not only one of\nthese CJK languages but support almost all languages simultaneously by\ndynamically switching keyboard modes with GUI on the fly.\n\nThe im-config package installs a hook script /etc/X11/Xsession.d/70im-\nconfig_launch. When X starts, it sources this file as a POSIX shell\ncode.  Then this hook script tries to source the user configuration\nfile ~/.xinputrc, if it exists.\tOtherwise, this hook script sources\nthe system configuration file /etc/X11/xinit/xinputrc.\n\nim-config invoked from a user account updates the user configuration\nfile ~/.xinputrc.  im-config invoked from the root account updates the\nsystem configuration file ~/etc/X11/xinit/xinputrc.  The essential\ncontents of generated files are:\n\nrun_im <input method name>\n\nWhen these files are sourced, the run_im shell function instructs to\nsource the initialization code for the corresponding input method. This\ninitialization code is defined in the <2 digits number>_<input method\nname>.rc file in /usr/share/im-config/data.\n\nThe im-config hook script, /etc/X11/Xsession.d/70im-config_launch,\nexports following variables to X programs: $XMODIFIERS, $GTK_IM_MODULE,\n$QT_IM_MODULE, $QT4_IM_MODULE, and $CLUTTER_IM_MODULE.\n\nThe im-config hook script, /etc/X11/Xsession.d/70im-config_launch, also\nset $STARTUP to use /usr/bin/im-launch for starting required daemons.\n\nIf you wish to create a custom configuration beyond what im-config can\ndo for you, please copy one of these initialization code files into\n~/.xinputrc or /etc/X11/xinit/xinputrc and edit it to suite your need.\nFor example, 02_cjkv.rc tells how input method can be customized for\neach locale.  This script should be written to set environment\nvariables if \"$IM_CONFIG_PHASE\" = 1 and to start daemon programs if\n\"$IM_CONFIG_PHASE\" = 2 .\n\nPlease note that this <2 digits number> part of these configuration\nfiles may change for every new releases of the im-config package.\n\nWhen a user makes manual changes to ~/.xinputrc or\n/etc/X11/xinit/xinputrc without using im-config, im-config will detect\nit using a md5sum hush value embedded in the shell comment and will not\noverwrite such files.  You must erase them manually if you wish to\nreplace them with ones created by im-config.\n\nThe <2 digits number>_<input method name>.conf files in /usr/share/im-\nconfig/data provide the UI data for im-config and the heuristic logic\nof selecting desirable input method under the auto mode.  The smaller\nnumber of the <2 digits number> indicates the higher priority of <input\nmethod name>.\n\nThese <2 digits number>_<input method name>.conf files define few\nvariables and functions.  The value of IM_CONFIG_SHORT is the short\ndescription of the input method for the menu.  The value of\nIM_CONFIG_LONG is the long description of the input method explaining\nits package dependency.\tThe package_menu shell function defines as a\nfunction to return true if any associated input method packages are\ninstalled to activate its menu entry.  The package_auto shell function\ndefines as a function to return true if the sufficient input method\npackages are installed for the auto mode.  These definitions use the\npackage_status shell function which takes package name as its argument\nand returns true if it is installed properly.\n\nThe menu lists input methods with the <2 digits number> between 00 and\n89.  The auto mode considers its input method candidate from <2 digits\nnumber> between 10 and 79 in this order.  The usage convention of <2\ndigits number> is:\n\n00-09:  Input Method choice mode       (default/auto/cjkv/REMOVE)\n\n10-49:  Input Method supporting multiple languages.(auto ready)\n\n50-79:  Input Method supporting limited languages. (auto ready)\n\n80-89:  Input Method (deprecated one) (not for auto)\n\n90-99:  Used internally by im-config (not for auto)\n\nThis structure ensures to have different input methods to be installed\nside-by-side with minimal user configurations."

There is\nactually only one main program; the specific layout algorithms are\nimplemented as plugins. Thus, they largely share all of the same\ncommand-line options.\n\ndot draws directed graphs.  It works well on directed acyclic graphs\nand other graphs that can be drawn as hierarchies or have a natural\n``flow.''\n\nneato draws undirected graphs using a ``spring'' model and reducing the\nrelated energy (see Kamada and Kawai, Information Processing Letters\n31:1, April 1989).\n\ntwopi draws graphs using a radial layout (see G. Wills, Symposium on\nGraph Drawing GD'97, September, 1997).  Basically, one node is chosen\nas the center and put at the origin.  The remaining nodes are placed on\na sequence of concentric circles centered about the origin, each a\nfixed radial distance from the previous circle.\tAll nodes distance 1\nfrom the center are placed on the first circle; all nodes distance 1\nfrom a node on the first circle are placed on the second circle; and so\nforth.\n\ncirco draws graphs using a circular layout (see Six and Tollis, GD '99\nand ALENEX '99, and Kaufmann and Wiese, GD '02.)  The tool identifies\nbiconnected components and draws the nodes of the component on a\ncircle. The block\u2010cutpoint tree is then laid out using a recursive\nradial algorithm. Edge crossings within a circle are minimized by\nplacing as many edges on the circle's perimeter as possible.  In\nparticular, if the component is outerplanar, the component will have a\nplanar layout.  If a node belongs to multiple non\u2010trivial biconnected\ncomponents, the layout puts the node in one of them. By default, this\nis the first non\u2010trivial component found in the search from the root\ncomponent.\n\nfdp draws undirected graphs using a ``spring'' model. It relies on a\nforce\u2010directed approach in the spirit of Fruchterman and Reingold (cf.\nSoftware\u2010Practice & Experience 21(11), 1991, pp. 1129\u20101164).\n\nsfdp also draws undirected graphs using the ``spring'' model described\nabove, but it uses a multi-scale approach to produce layouts of large\ngraphs in a reasonably short time.\n\npatchwork draws the graph as a squarified treemap (see M. Bruls et al.,\n``Squarified treemaps'', Proc. Joint Eurographics and IEEE TCVG Symp.\non Visualization, 2000, pp. 33-42). The clusters of the graph are used\nto specify the tree.\n\nosage draws the graph using its cluster structure. For a given cluster,\neach of its subclusters is laid out internally.\tThen the subclusters,\nplus any remaining nodes, are repositioned based on the cluster's pack\nand packmode attributes."

Something like this might make a\nsuitable replacement for xev; I'm not signing up, mind you, but it's an\ninteresting idea.\n\nThe xkbevd event daemon listens for specified XKB events and executes\nrequested commands if they occur.  The configuration file consists of a\nlist of event specification/action pairs and/or variable definitions.\n\nAn event specification consists of a short XKB event name followed by a\nstring or identifier which serves as a qualifier in parentheses; empty\nparenthesis indicate no qualification and serve to specify the default\ncommand which is applied to events which do not match any of the other\nspecifications.\tThe interpretation of the qualifier depends on the\ntype of the event: Bell events match using the name of the bell,\nmessage events match on the contents of the message string and slow key\nevents accept any of press, release, accept, or reject.\tNo other\nevents are currently recognized.\n\nAn action consists of an optional keyword followed by an optional\nstring argument.  Currently, xkbev recognizes the actions: none,\nignore, echo, printEvent, sound, and shell.  If the action is not\nspecified, the string is taken as the name of a sound file to be played\nunless it begins with an exclamation point, in which case it is taken\nas a shell command.\n\nVariable definitions in the argument string are expanded with fields\nfrom the event in question before the argument string is passed to the\naction processor.  The general syntax for a variable is either $c or\n$(str), where c is a single character and str is a string of arbitrary\nlength.\tAll parameters have both single-character and long names.\n\nThe list of recognized parameters varies from event to event and is too\nlong to list here right now.  This is a developer release anyway, so\nyou can be expected to look at the source code (evargs.c is of\nparticular interest).\n\nThe ignore, echo, printEvent, sound,and shell actions do what you would\nexpect commands named ignore, echo, printEvent, sound, and shell to do,\nexcept that the sound command has only been implemented and tested for\nSGI machines.  It launches an external program right now, so it should\nbe pretty easy to adapt, especially if you like audio cues that arrive\nabout a half-second after you expect them.\n\nThe only currently recognized variables are soundDirectory and\nsoundCmd.

The block\ndevice or image file is then probed for a file system label and other\nmetadata, and is mounted to a directory below /run/media/system/ whose\nname is generated from the file system label. In this mode the block\ndevice or image file must exist at the time of invocation of the\ncommand, so that it may be probed. If the device is found to be a\nremovable block device (e.g. a USB stick) an automount point instead of\na regular mount point is created (i.e. the --automount= option is\nimplied, see below).\n\nIf two arguments are specified the first indicates the mount source\n(the WHAT) and the second indicates the path to mount it on (the\nWHERE). In this mode no probing of the source is attempted, and a\nbacking device node doesn't have to exist yet. However, if this mode is\ncombined with --discover, device node probing for additional metadata\nis enabled, and \u2013 much like in the single-argument case discussed above\n\u2013 the specified device has to exist at the time of invocation of the\ncommand.\n\nUse the --list command to show a terse table of all local, known block\ndevices with file systems that may be mounted with this command.\n\nsystemd-umount can be used to unmount a mount or automount point.

With metadata starting at 4 KiB and\ndefault_data_alignment 1 (MiB), setting --metadatasize 2048k results in\npe_start of 3 MiB and mda_size of 3068 KiB.  Alternatively,\n--metadatasize 2044k results in pe_start at 2 MiB and mda_size of 2044\nKiB.\n\nThe alignment of pe_start described above may be automatically\noverriden based on md device properties or device i/o properties\nreported in sysfs.  These automatic adjustments can be enabled/disabled\nusing lvm.conf settings md_chunk_alignment and\ndata_alignment_offset_detection.\n\nTo use a different pe_start alignment, use the --dataalignment option.\nThe --metadatasize option would also typically be used in this case\nbecause the metadata area size also determines the location of\npe_start.  When using these two options together, pe_start is\ncalculated as: metadata area start (page size), plus the specified\n--metadatasize, rounded up to the next multiple of --dataalignment.\nWith metadata starting at 4 KiB, --metadatasize 2048k, and\n--dataalignment 128k, pe_start is 2176 KiB and mda_size is 2172 KiB.\nThe pe_start of 2176 KiB is the nearest even multiple of 128 KiB that\nprovides at least 2048 KiB of metadata space.  Always check the\nresulting alignment and metadata size when using these options.\n\nTo shift an aligned pe_start value, use the --dataaligmentoffset\noption.\tThe pe_start alignment is calculated as described above, and\nthen the value specified with --dataaligmentoffset is added to produce\nthe final pe_start value."

Unlike the daemon itself, dbus-launch exits, so\nbackticks or the $() construct can be used to read information from\ndbus-launch.\n\nWith no arguments, dbus-launch will launch a session bus instance and\nprint the address and PID of that instance to standard output.\n\nYou may specify a program to be run; in this case, dbus-launch will\nlaunch a session bus instance, set the appropriate environment\nvariables so the specified program can find the bus, and then execute\nthe specified program, with the specified arguments. See below for\nexamples.\n\nIf you launch a program, dbus-launch will not print the information\nabout the new bus to standard output.\n\nWhen dbus-launch prints bus information to standard output, by default\nit is in a simple key-value pairs format. However, you may request\nseveral alternate syntaxes using the --sh-syntax, --csh-syntax,\n--binary-syntax, or --auto-syntax options. Several of these cause\ndbus-launch to emit shell code to set up the environment.\n\nWith the --auto-syntax option, dbus-launch looks at the value of the\nSHELL environment variable to determine which shell syntax should be\nused. If SHELL ends in \"csh\", then csh-compatible code is emitted;\notherwise Bourne shell code is emitted. Instead of passing\n--auto-syntax, you may explicitly specify a particular one by using\n--sh-syntax for Bourne syntax, or --csh-syntax for csh syntax. In\nscripts, it's more robust to avoid --auto-syntax and you hopefully know\nwhich shell your script is written in.\n\nSee http://www.freedesktop.org/software/dbus/ for more information\nabout D-Bus.

The compression\nproduces partial raw deflate streams which are concatenated by a single\nwrite thread and wrapped with the appropriate header and trailer, where\nthe trailer contains the combined check value.\n\nEach partial raw deflate stream is terminated by an empty stored block\n(using the Z_SYNC_FLUSH option of zlib), in order to end that partial\nbit stream at a byte boundary.

As a result, pigz uses a\nsingle thread (the main thread) for decompression, but will create\nthree other threads for reading, writing, and check calculation, which\ncan speed up decompression under some circumstances.

The remaining nodes are placed on\na sequence of concentric circles centered about the origin, each a\nfixed radial distance from the previous circle.\tAll nodes distance 1\nfrom the center are placed on the first circle; all nodes distance 1\nfrom a node on the first circle are placed on the second circle; and so\nforth.\n\ncirco draws graphs using a circular layout (see Six and Tollis, GD '99\nand ALENEX '99, and Kaufmann and Wiese, GD '02.)  The tool identifies\nbiconnected components and draws the nodes of the component on a\ncircle. The block\u2010cutpoint tree is then laid out using a recursive\nradial algorithm. Edge crossings within a circle are minimized by\nplacing as many edges on the circle's perimeter as possible.  In\nparticular, if the component is outerplanar, the component will have a\nplanar layout.  If a node belongs to multiple non\u2010trivial biconnected\ncomponents, the layout puts the node in one of them. By default, this\nis the first non\u2010trivial component found in the search from the root\ncomponent.\n\nfdp draws undirected graphs using a ``spring'' model. It relies on a\nforce\u2010directed approach in the spirit of Fruchterman and Reingold (cf.\nSoftware\u2010Practice & Experience 21(11), 1991, pp. 1129\u20101164).\n\nsfdp also draws undirected graphs using the ``spring'' model described\nabove, but it uses a multi-scale approach to produce layouts of large\ngraphs in a reasonably short time.\n\npatchwork draws the graph as a squarified treemap (see M. Bruls et al.,\n``Squarified treemaps'', Proc. Joint Eurographics and IEEE TCVG Symp.\non Visualization, 2000, pp. 33-42). The clusters of the graph are used\nto specify the tree.\n\nosage draws the graph using its cluster structure.

This version has\nmany features which make it appear similar in some respects to the Korn\nshell, but it is not a Korn shell clone (see ksh(1)).  Only features\ndesignated by POSIX, plus a few Berkeley extensions, are being\nincorporated into this shell.  This man page is not intended to be a\ntutorial or a complete specification of the shell.\n\nOverview\nThe shell is a command that reads lines from either a file or the\nterminal, interprets them, and generally executes other commands.\tIt is\nthe program that is running when a user logs into the system (although a\nuser can select a different shell with the chsh(1) command).  The shell\nimplements a language that has flow control constructs, a macro facility\nthat provides a variety of features in addition to data storage, along\nwith built in history and line editing capabilities.  It incorporates\nmany features to aid interactive use and has the advantage that the\ninterpretative language is common to both interactive and non-interactive\nuse (shell scripts).  That is, commands can be typed directly to the\nrunning shell or can be put into a file and the file can be executed\ndirectly by the shell.\n\nInvocation\nIf no args are present and if the standard input of the shell is\nconnected to a terminal (or if the -i flag is set), and the -c option is\nnot present, the shell is considered an interactive shell.  An\ninteractive shell generally prompts before each command and handles\nprogramming and command errors differently (as described below).  When\nfirst starting, the shell inspects argument 0, and if it begins with a\ndash \u2018-\u2019, the shell is also considered a login shell.  This is normally\ndone automatically by the system when the user first logs in.  A login\nshell first reads commands from the files /etc/profile and .profile if\nthey exist.  If the environment variable ENV is set on entry to an\ninteractive shell, or is set in the .profile of a login shell, the shell\nnext reads commands from the file named in ENV.  Therefore, a user should\nplace commands that are to be executed only at login time in the .profile\nfile, and commands that are executed for every interactive shell inside\nthe ENV file.  To set the ENV variable to some file, place the following\nline in your .profile of your home directory"

It works well on directed acyclic graphs\nand other graphs that can be drawn as hierarchies or have a natural\n``flow.''\n\nneato draws undirected graphs using a ``spring'' model and reducing the\nrelated energy (see Kamada and Kawai, Information Processing Letters\n31:1, April 1989).\n\ntwopi draws graphs using a radial layout (see G. Wills, Symposium on\nGraph Drawing GD'97, September, 1997).  Basically, one node is chosen\nas the center and put at the origin.  The remaining nodes are placed on\na sequence of concentric circles centered about the origin, each a\nfixed radial distance from the previous circle.\tAll nodes distance 1\nfrom the center are placed on the first circle; all nodes distance 1\nfrom a node on the first circle are placed on the second circle; and so\nforth.\n\ncirco draws graphs using a circular layout (see Six and Tollis, GD '99\nand ALENEX '99, and Kaufmann and Wiese, GD '02.)  The tool identifies\nbiconnected components and draws the nodes of the component on a\ncircle. The block\u2010cutpoint tree is then laid out using a recursive\nradial algorithm. Edge crossings within a circle are minimized by\nplacing as many edges on the circle's perimeter as possible.  In\nparticular, if the component is outerplanar, the component will have a\nplanar layout.  If a node belongs to multiple non\u2010trivial biconnected\ncomponents, the layout puts the node in one of them. By default, this\nis the first non\u2010trivial component found in the search from the root\ncomponent.\n\nfdp draws undirected graphs using a ``spring'' model. It relies on a\nforce\u2010directed approach in the spirit of Fruchterman and Reingold (cf.\nSoftware\u2010Practice & Experience 21(11), 1991, pp. 1129\u20101164).\n\nsfdp also draws undirected graphs using the ``spring'' model described\nabove, but it uses a multi-scale approach to produce layouts of large\ngraphs in a reasonably short time.\n\npatchwork draws the graph as a squarified treemap (see M. Bruls et al.,\n``Squarified treemaps'', Proc. Joint Eurographics and IEEE TCVG Symp.\non Visualization, 2000, pp. 33-42). The clusters of the graph are used\nto specify the tree.\n\nosage draws the graph using its cluster structure. For a given cluster,\neach of its subclusters is laid out internally.\tThen the subclusters,\nplus any remaining nodes, are repositioned based on the cluster's pack\nand packmode attributes."

If the editor is quit\nwithout modifying the temporary file, debchange will exit without\ntouching the existing changelog.  Note that the changelog is assumed to\nbe encoded with the UTF-8 encoding.  If it is not, problems may occur.\nPlease see the iconv(1) manpage to find out how to convert changelogs\nfrom legacy encodings.  Finally, a changelog or NEWS file can be\ncreated from scratch using the --create option described below.\n\ndebchange also supports automatically producing bug-closing changelog\nentries, using the --closes option.  This will usually query the BTS,\nthe Debian Bug Tracking System (see https://bugs.debian.org/) to\ndetermine the title of the bug and the package in which it occurs.\nThis behaviour can be stopped by giving a --noquery option or by\nsetting the configuration variable DEBCHANGE_QUERY_BTS to no, as\ndescribed below.  In either case, the editor (as described above) will\nalways be invoked to give an opportunity to modify the entries, and the\nchangelog will be accepted whether or not modifications are made.

The default changelog heuristic assumes the\npackage has been released unless its changelog contains UNRELEASED in\nthe distribution field. If this heuristic is enabled then the\ndistribution will default to UNRELEASED in new changelog entries, and\nthe --mainttrailer option described below will be automatically\nenabled. This can be useful if a package can be released by different\nmaintainers, or if you do not keep the upload logs. The alternate log\nheuristic determines if a package has been released by looking for an\nappropriate dupload(1) or dput(1) log file in the parent directory.  A\nwarning will be issued if the log file is found but a successful upload\nis not recorded. This may be because the previous upload was performed\nwith a version of dupload prior to 2.1 or because the upload failed.\n\nIf either --increment or --newversion is used, the name and email for\nthe new version will be determined as follows.  If the environment\nvariable DEBFULLNAME is set, this will be used for the maintainer full\nname; if not, then NAME will be checked.  If the environment variable\nDEBEMAIL is set, this will be used for the email address.  If this\nvariable has the form \"name <email>\", then the maintainer name will\nalso be taken from here if neither DEBFULLNAME nor NAME is set.\tIf\nthis variable is not set, the same test is performed on the environment\nvariable EMAIL.\tNext, if the full name has still not been determined,\nthen use getpwuid(3) to determine the name from the password file.  If\nthis fails, use the previous changelog entry.  For the email address,\nif it has not been set from DEBEMAIL or EMAIL, then look in\n/etc/mailname, then attempt to build it from the username and FQDN,\notherwise use the email address in the previous changelog entry.  In\nother words, it's a good idea to set DEBEMAIL and DEBFULLNAME when\nusing this script.\n\nSupport is included for changelogs that record changes by multiple co-\nmaintainers of a package. If an entry is appended to the current\nversion's entries, and the maintainer is different from the maintainer\nwho is listed as having done the previous entries, then lines will be\nadded to the changelog to tell which maintainers made which changes.\nCurrently only one of the several such styles of recording this\ninformation is supported, in which the name of the maintainer who made\na set of changes appears on a line before the changes, inside square\nbrackets. This can be switched on and off using the --[no]multimaint\noption or the DEBCHANGE_MULTIMAINT configuration file option; the\ndefault is to enable it.  Note that if an entry has already been marked\nin this way, then this option will be silently ignored.\n\nIf the directory name of the source tree has the form package-version,\nthen debchange will also attempt to rename it if the (upstream) version\nnumber changes.\tThis can be prevented by using the --preserve command\nline or configuration file option as described below.\n\nIf --force-bad-version or --allow-lower-version is used, debchange will\nnot stop if the new version is less than the current one.  This is\nespecially useful while doing backports."

A Volume Group (VG) is a\ncollection of one or more physical devices, each called a Physical\nVolume (PV).  A Logical Volume (LV) is a virtual block device that can\nbe used by the system or applications.  Each block of data in an LV is\nstored on one or more PV in the VG, according to algorithms implemented\nby Device Mapper (DM) in the kernel.\n\nThe lvm command, and other commands listed below, are the command-line\ntools for LVM.  A separate manual page describes each command in\ndetail.\n\nIf lvm is invoked with no arguments it presents a readline prompt\n(assuming it was compiled with readline support).  LVM commands may be\nentered interactively at this prompt with readline facilities including\nhistory and command name and option completion.\tRefer to readline(3)\nfor details.\n\nIf lvm is invoked with argv[0] set to the name of a specific LVM\ncommand (for example by using a hard or soft link) it acts as that\ncommand.\n\nOn invocation, lvm requires that only the standard file descriptors\nstdin, stdout and stderr are available.\tIf others are found, they get\nclosed and messages are issued warning about the leak.  This warning\ncan be suppressed by setting the environment variable\nLVM_SUPPRESS_FD_WARNINGS.\n\nWhere commands take VG or LV names as arguments, the full path name is\noptional.  An LV called \"lvol0\" in a VG called \"vg0\" can be specified\nas \"vg0/lvol0\".\tWhere a list of VGs is required but is left empty, a\nlist of all VGs will be substituted.  Where a list of LVs is required\nbut a VG is given, a list of all the LVs in that VG will be\nsubstituted.  So lvdisplay vg0 will display all the LVs in \"vg0\".  Tags\ncan also be used - see --addtag below.\n\nOne advantage of using the built-in shell is that configuration\ninformation gets cached internally between commands.\n\nA file containing a simple script with one command per line can also be\ngiven on the command line.  The script can also be executed directly if\nthe first line is #! followed by the absolute path of lvm.\n\nAdditional hyphens within option names are ignored.

The following command,\nwritten in the traditional style, instructs tar to store all files from\nthe directory /etc into the archive file etc.tar verbosely listing the\nfiles being archived:\n\ntar cfv a.tar /etc\n\nIn UNIX or short-option style, each option letter is prefixed with a\nsingle dash, as in other command line utilities.  If an option takes\nargument, the argument follows it, either as a separate command line\nword, or immediately following the option.  However, if the option\ntakes an optional argument, the argument must follow the option letter\nwithout any intervening whitespace, as in -g/tmp/snar.db.\n\nAny number of options not taking arguments can be clustered together\nafter a single dash, e.g. -vkp.\tOptions that take arguments (whether\nmandatory or optional), can appear at the end of such a cluster, e.g.\n-vkpf a.tar.\n\nThe example command above written in the short-option style could look\nlike:\n\ntar -cvf a.tar /etc\nor\ntar -c -v -f a.tar /etc\n\nIn GNU or long-option style, each option begins with two dashes and has\na meaningful name, consisting of lower-case letters and dashes.\tWhen\nused, the long option can be abbreviated to its initial letters,\nprovided that this does not create ambiguity.  Arguments to long\noptions are supplied either as a separate command line word,\nimmediately following the option, or separated from the option by an\nequals sign with no intervening whitespace.  Optional arguments must\nalways use the latter method.\n\nHere are several ways of writing the example command in this style:\n\ntar --create --file a.tar --verbose /etc\nor (abbreviating some options):\ntar --cre --file=a.tar --verb /etc\n\nThe options in all three styles can be intermixed, although doing so\nwith old options is not encouraged.\n\nOperation mode\nThe options listed in the table below tell GNU tar what operation it is\nto perform.  Exactly one of them must be given.\tMeaning of non-\noptional arguments depends on the operation mode requested.\n"

These rules inspect the ARP\nframes which they see.  arptables is analogous to the iptables user\nspace tool, but arptables is less complicated.\n\nCHAINS\nThe kernel table is used to divide functionality into different sets of\nrules. Each set of rules is called a chain.  Each chain is an ordered\nlist of rules that can match ARP frames. If a rule matches an ARP\nframe, then a processing specification tells what to do with that\nmatching frame. The processing specification is called a 'target'.\nHowever, if the frame does not match the current rule in the chain,\nthen the next rule in the chain is examined and so forth.  The user can\ncreate new (user-defined) chains which can be used as the 'target' of a\nrule.\n\nTARGETS\nA firewall rule specifies criteria for an ARP frame and a frame\nprocessing specification called a target.  When a frame matches a rule,\nthen the next action performed by the kernel is specified by the\ntarget.\tThe target can be one of these values: ACCEPT, DROP, CONTINUE,\nRETURN, an 'extension' (see below) or a user-defined chain.\n\nACCEPT means to let the frame through.  DROP means the frame has to be\ndropped.  CONTINUE means the next rule has to be checked. This can be\nhandy to know how many frames pass a certain point in the chain or to\nlog those frames.  RETURN means stop traversing this chain and resume\nat the next rule in the previous (calling) chain.  For the extension\ntargets please see the TARGET EXTENSIONS section of this man page.\n\nTABLES\nThere is only one ARP table in the Linux kernel.  The table is filter.\nYou can drop the '-t filter' argument to the arptables command.\tThe -t\nargument must be the first argument on the arptables command line, if\nused.\n"

Prefixing the field name with some text followed by an\nequality sign (for example, -c 'Package name=Package') modifies the\ncolumn in such a way that the text before the equality sign is used as\nthe column title, while the text after the equality sign is used as the\nname of the field from which data is drawn.

    "command": "gunzip",
    "description": "compress or expand files\nGzip reduces the size of the named files using Lempel-Ziv coding\n(LZ77).\tWhenever possible, each file is replaced by one with the\nextension .gz, while keeping the same ownership modes, access and\nmodification times.  (The default extension is z for MSDOS, OS/2 FAT,\nWindows NT FAT and Atari.)  If no files are specified, or if a file\nname is \"-\", the standard input is compressed to the standard output.\nGzip will only attempt to compress regular files.  In particular, it\nwill ignore symbolic links.\n\nIf the compressed file name is too long for its file system, gzip\ntruncates it.  Gzip attempts to truncate only the parts of the file\nname longer than 3 characters.  (A part is delimited by dots.) If the\nname consists of small parts only, the longest parts are truncated. For\nexample, if file names are limited to 14 characters, gzip.msdos.exe is\ncompressed to gzi.msd.exe.gz.  Names are not truncated on systems which\ndo not have a limit on file name length.\n\nBy default, gzip keeps the original file name and timestamp in the\ncompressed file. These are used when decompressing the file with the -N\noption. This is useful when the compressed file name was truncated or\nwhen the timestamp was not preserved after a file transfer.\n\nCompressed files can be restored to their original form using gzip -d\nor gunzip or zcat.  If the original name saved in the compressed file\nis not suitable for its file system, a new name is constructed from the\noriginal one to make it legal.\n\ngunzip takes a list of files on its command line and replaces each file\nwhose name ends with .gz, -gz, .z, -z, or _z (ignoring case) and which\nbegins with the correct magic number with an uncompressed file without\nthe original extension.\tgunzip also recognizes the special extensions\n.tgz and .taz as shorthands for .tar.gz and .tar.Z respectively.  When\ncompressing, gzip uses the .tgz extension if necessary instead of\ntruncating a file with a .tar extension.\n\ngunzip can currently decompress files created by gzip, zip, compress,\ncompress -H or pack.  The detection of the input format is automatic.\nWhen using the first two formats, gunzip checks a 32 bit CRC. For pack\nand gunzip checks the uncompressed length. The standard compress format\nwas not designed to allow consistency checks. However gunzip is\nsometimes able to detect a bad .Z file. If you get an error when\nuncompressing a .Z file, do not assume that the .Z file is correct\nsimply because the standard uncompress does not complain. This\ngenerally means that the standard uncompress does not check its input,\nand happily generates garbage output.  The SCO compress -H format (lzh\ncompression method) does not include a CRC but also allows some\nconsistency checks.\n\nFiles created by zip can be uncompressed by gzip only if they have a\nsingle member compressed with the 'deflation' method. This feature is\nonly intended to help conversion of tar.zip files to the tar.gz format.\nTo extract a zip file with a single member, use a command like gunzip\n<foo.zip or gunzip -S .zip foo.zip.  To extract zip files with several\nmembers, use unzip instead of gunzip.\n\nzcat is identical to gunzip -c.\t(On some systems, zcat may be\ninstalled as gzcat to preserve the original link to compress.)  zcat\nuncompresses either a list of files on the command line or its standard\ninput and writes the uncompressed data on standard output.  zcat will\nuncompress files that have the correct magic number whether they have a\n.gz suffix or not.\n\nGzip uses the Lempel-Ziv algorithm used in zip and PKZIP.  The amount\nof compression obtained depends on the size of the input and the\ndistribution of common substrings.  Typically, text such as source code\nor English is reduced by 60-70%.  Compression is generally much better\nthan that achieved by LZW (as used in compress), Huffman coding (as\nused in pack), or adaptive Huffman coding (compact).\n\nCompression is always performed, even if the compressed file is\nslightly larger than the original. The worst case expansion is a few\nbytes for the gzip file header, plus 5 bytes every 32K block, or an\nexpansion ratio of 0.015% for large files. Note that the actual number\nof used disk blocks almost never increases.  gzip preserves the mode,\nownership and timestamps of files when compressing or decompressing."

If no\nformatting information is supplied, internal defaults are used.\tIf a\nproperty is not defined on the selected window or font, \"not defined\"\nis printed as the value for that property.  If no property list is\ngiven, all the properties possessed by the selected window or font are\nprinted.\n\nA window may be selected in one of four ways.  First, if the desired\nwindow is the root window, the -root argument may be used.  If the\ndesired window is not the root window, it may be selected in two ways\non the command line, either by id number such as might be obtained from\nxwininfo, or by name if the window possesses a name.  The -id argument\nselects a window by id number in either decimal or hex (must start with\n0x) while the -name argument selects a window by name.\n\nThe last way to select a window does not involve the command line at\nall.  If none of -font, -id, -name, and -root are specified, a\ncrosshairs cursor is displayed and the user is allowed to choose any\nvisible window by pressing any pointer button in the desired window.\nIf it is desired to display properties of a font as opposed to a\nwindow, the -font argument must be used.\n\nOther than the above four arguments and the -help argument for\nobtaining help, and the -grammar argument for listing the full grammar\nfor the command line, all the other command line arguments are used in\nspecifying both the format of the properties to be displayed and how to\ndisplay them.  The -len n argument specifies that at most n bytes of\nany given property will be read and displayed.  This is useful for\nexample when displaying the cut buffer on the root window which could\nrun to several pages if displayed in full.\n\nNormally each property name is displayed by printing first the property\nname then its type (if it has one) in parentheses followed by its\nvalue.  The -notype argument specifies that property types should not\nbe displayed.  The -fs argument is used to specify a file containing a\nlist of formats for properties while the -f argument is used to specify\nthe format for one property.\n\nThe formatting information for a property actually consists of two\nparts, a format and a dformat.  The format specifies the actual\nformatting of the property (i.e., is it made up of words, bytes, or\nlongs?, etc.) while the dformat specifies how the property should be\ndisplayed.\n\nThe following paragraphs describe how to construct formats and\ndformats.  However, for the vast majority of users and uses, this\nshould not be necessary as the built in defaults contain the formats\nand dformats necessary to display all the standard properties.  It\nshould only be necessary to specify formats and dformats if a new\nproperty is being dealt with or the user dislikes the standard display\nformat.\tNew users especially are encouraged to skip this part.\n\nA format consists of one of 0, 8, 16, or 32 followed by a sequence of\none or more format characters.  The 0, 8, 16, or 32 specifies how many\nbits per field there are in the property.  Zero is a special case\nmeaning use the field size information associated with the property\nitself.\t(This is only needed for special cases like type INTEGER which\nis actually three different types depending on the size of the fields\nof the property.)\n\nA value of 8 means that the property is a sequence of bytes while a\nvalue of 16 would mean that the property is a sequence of words.  The\ndifference between these two lies in the fact that the sequence of\nwords will be byte swapped while the sequence of bytes will not be when\nread by a machine of the opposite byte order of the machine that\noriginally wrote the property.  For more information on how properties\nare formatted and stored, consult the Xlib manual.\n\nOnce the size of the fields has been specified, it is necessary to\nspecify the type of each field (i.e., is it an integer, a string, an\natom, or what?)\tThis is done using one format character per field.  If\nthere are more fields in the property than format characters supplied,\nthe last character will be repeated as many times as necessary for the\nextra fields.  The format characters and their meaning are as follows:\n"

On a UNIX machine the encrypted SMB\npasswords are usually stored in the default passdb backend.\n\nWhen run by an ordinary user with no options, smbpasswd will prompt\nthem for their old SMB password and then ask them for their new\npassword twice, to ensure that the new password was typed correctly.

The names of the files to be patched are\nusually taken from the patch file, but if there's just one file to be\npatched it can be specified on the command line as originalfile.\n\nUpon startup, patch attempts to determine the type of the diff listing,\nunless overruled by a -c (--context), -e (--ed), -n (--normal), or -u\n(--unified) option.  Context diffs (old-style, new-style, and unified)\nand normal diffs are applied by the patch program itself, while ed\ndiffs are simply fed to the ed(1) editor via a pipe.\n\npatch tries to skip any leading garbage, apply the diff, and then skip\nany trailing garbage.  Thus you could feed an article or message\ncontaining a diff listing to patch, and it should work.\tIf the entire\ndiff is indented by a consistent amount, if lines end in CRLF, or if a\ndiff is encapsulated one or more times by prepending \"- \" to lines\nstarting with \"-\" as specified by Internet RFC 934, this is taken into\naccount.  After removing indenting or encapsulation, lines beginning\nwith # are ignored, as they are considered to be comments.\n\nWith context diffs, and to a lesser extent with normal diffs, patch can\ndetect when the line numbers mentioned in the patch are incorrect, and\nattempts to find the correct place to apply each hunk of the patch.  As\na first guess, it takes the line number mentioned for the hunk, plus or\nminus any offset used in applying the previous hunk.  If that is not\nthe correct place, patch scans both forwards and backwards for a set of\nlines matching the context given in the hunk.  First patch looks for a\nplace where all lines of the context match.  If no such place is found,\nand it's a context diff, and the maximum fuzz factor is set to 1 or\nmore, then another scan takes place ignoring the first and last line of\ncontext.  If that fails, and the maximum fuzz factor is set to 2 or\nmore, the first two and last two lines of context are ignored, and\nanother scan is made.  (The default maximum fuzz factor is 2.)\n\nHunks with less prefix context than suffix context (after applying\nfuzz) must apply at the start of the file if their first line number\nis 1.  Hunks with more prefix context than suffix context (after\napplying fuzz) must apply at the end of the file.\n\nIf patch cannot find a place to install that hunk of the patch, it puts\nthe hunk out to a reject file, which normally is the name of the output\nfile plus a .rej suffix, or # if .rej would generate a file name that\nis too long (if even appending the single character # makes the file\nname too long, then # replaces the file name's last character).\n\nThe rejected hunk comes out in unified or context diff format.  If the\ninput was a normal diff, many of the contexts are simply null.  The\nline numbers on the hunks in the reject file may be different than in\nthe patch file: they reflect the approximate location patch thinks the\nfailed hunks belong in the new file rather than the old one.\n\nAs each hunk is completed, you are told if the hunk failed, and if so\nwhich line (in the new file) patch thought the hunk should go on.  If\nthe hunk is installed at a different line from the line number\nspecified in the diff, you are told the offset.\tA single large offset\nmay indicate that a hunk was installed in the wrong place.  You are\nalso told if a fuzz factor was used to make the match, in which case\nyou should also be slightly suspicious.\tIf the --verbose option is\ngiven, you are also told about hunks that match exactly.\n\nIf no original file origfile is specified on the command line, patch\ntries to figure out from the leading garbage what the name of the file\nto edit is, using the following rules.\n\nFirst, patch takes an ordered list of candidate file names as follows:"

It is called a macro processor because it allows you to\ndefine macros, which are brief abbreviations for longer constructs.\n\nThe C preprocessor is intended to be used only with C, C++, and\nObjective-C source code.  In the past, it has been abused as a general\ntext processor.\tIt will choke on input which does not obey C's lexical\nrules.  For example, apostrophes will be interpreted as the beginning\nof character constants, and cause errors.  Also, you cannot rely on it\npreserving characteristics of the input which are not significant to\nC-family languages.  If a Makefile is preprocessed, all the hard tabs\nwill be removed, and the Makefile will not work.\n\nHaving said that, you can often get away with using cpp on things which\nare not C.  Other Algol-ish programming languages are often safe (Ada,\netc.) So is assembly, with caution.  -traditional-cpp mode preserves\nmore white space, and is otherwise more permissive.  Many of the\nproblems can be avoided by writing C or C++ style comments instead of\nnative language comments, and keeping macros simple.\n\nWherever possible, you should use a preprocessor geared to the language\nyou are writing in.  Modern versions of the GNU assembler have macro\nfacilities.  Most high level programming languages have their own\nconditional compilation and inclusion mechanism.  If all else fails,\ntry a true general text processor, such as GNU M4.\n\nC preprocessors vary in some details.  This manual discusses the GNU C\npreprocessor, which provides a small superset of the features of ISO\nStandard C.  In its default mode, the GNU C preprocessor does not do a\nfew things required by the standard.  These are features which are\nrarely, if ever, used, and may cause surprising changes to the meaning\nof a program which does not expect them.  To get strict ISO Standard C,\nyou should use the -std=c90, -std=c99, -std=c11 or -std=c17 options,\ndepending on which version of the standard you want.  To get all the\nmandatory diagnostics, you must also use -pedantic.\n\nThis manual describes the behavior of the ISO preprocessor.  To\nminimize gratuitous differences, where the ISO preprocessor's behavior\ndoes not conflict with traditional semantics, the traditional\npreprocessor should behave the same way.  The various differences that\ndo exist are detailed in the section Traditional Mode.\n\nFor clarity, unless noted otherwise, references to CPP in this manual\nrefer to GNU CPP."

These can be used when decompressing the file with the\n-d option. This is useful when the compressed file name was truncated\nor when the time stamp was not preserved after a file transfer.\n\nlzop preserves the ownership, mode and time stamp of files when\ncompressing.

In the unfiltered mode all messages are sent on as they are\nreceived. In the filtering mode policy is applied to determine which\nmessages to allow, and which to drop.\n\nFiltering is applied only to outgoing signals and method calls and\nincoming broadcast signals. All replies (errors or method returns) are\nallowed once for an outstanding method call, and never otherwise.\n\nIf a client ever receives a message from another peer on the bus, the\nsenders unique name is made visible, so the client can track caller\nlifetimes via NameOwnerChanged signals. If a client calls a method on\nor receives a broadcast signal from a name (even if filtered to some\nsubset of paths or interfaces), that names basic policy is considered\nto be (at least) TALK, from then on.\n\nPolicy\nThe policy for the filtering consists of a mapping from well-known\nnames to a policy that is either SEE, TALK or OWN.

It works well on directed acyclic graphs\nand other graphs that can be drawn as hierarchies or have a natural\n``flow.''\n\nneato draws undirected graphs using a ``spring'' model and reducing the\nrelated energy (see Kamada and Kawai, Information Processing Letters\n31:1, April 1989).\n\ntwopi draws graphs using a radial layout (see G. Wills, Symposium on\nGraph Drawing GD'97, September, 1997).  Basically, one node is chosen\nas the center and put at the origin.  The remaining nodes are placed on\na sequence of concentric circles centered about the origin, each a\nfixed radial distance from the previous circle.\tAll nodes distance 1\nfrom the center are placed on the first circle; all nodes distance 1\nfrom a node on the first circle are placed on the second circle; and so\nforth.\n\ncirco draws graphs using a circular layout (see Six and Tollis, GD '99\nand ALENEX '99, and Kaufmann and Wiese, GD '02.)  The tool identifies\nbiconnected components and draws the nodes of the component on a\ncircle. The block\u2010cutpoint tree is then laid out using a recursive\nradial algorithm. Edge crossings within a circle are minimized by\nplacing as many edges on the circle's perimeter as possible.  In\nparticular, if the component is outerplanar, the component will have a\nplanar layout.  If a node belongs to multiple non\u2010trivial biconnected\ncomponents, the layout puts the node in one of them. By default, this\nis the first non\u2010trivial component found in the search from the root\ncomponent.\n\nfdp draws undirected graphs using a ``spring'' model. It relies on a\nforce\u2010directed approach in the spirit of Fruchterman and Reingold (cf.\nSoftware\u2010Practice & Experience 21(11), 1991, pp. 1129\u20101164).\n\nsfdp also draws undirected graphs using the ``spring'' model described\nabove, but it uses a multi-scale approach to produce layouts of large\ngraphs in a reasonably short time.\n\npatchwork draws the graph as a squarified treemap (see M. Bruls et al.,\n``Squarified treemaps'', Proc. Joint Eurographics and IEEE TCVG Symp.\non Visualization, 2000, pp. 33-42). The clusters of the graph are used\nto specify the tree.\n\nosage draws the graph using its cluster structure. For a given cluster,\neach of its subclusters is laid out internally.\tThen the subclusters,\nplus any remaining nodes, are repositioned based on the cluster's pack\nand packmode attributes."

Use it in concert with GCC to analyze\nyour programs to help create more efficient, faster running code and to\ndiscover untested parts of your program.  You can use gcov as a\nprofiling tool to help discover where your optimization efforts will\nbest affect your code.  You can also use gcov along with the other\nprofiling tool, gprof, to assess which parts of your code use the\ngreatest amount of computing time.\n\nProfiling tools help you analyze your code's performance.  Using a\nprofiler such as gcov or gprof, you can find out some basic performance\nstatistics, such as:\n\n*   how often each line of code executes\n\n*   what lines of code are actually executed\n\n*   how much computing time each section of code uses\n\nOnce you know these things about how your code works when compiled, you\ncan look at each module to see which modules should be optimized.  gcov\nhelps you determine where to work on optimization.\n\nSoftware developers also use coverage testing in concert with\ntestsuites, to make sure software is actually good enough for a\nrelease.  Testsuites can verify that a program works as expected; a\ncoverage program tests to see how much of the program is exercised by\nthe testsuite.  Developers can then determine what kinds of test cases\nneed to be added to the testsuites to create both better testing and a\nbetter final product.\n\nYou should compile your code without optimization if you plan to use\ngcov because the optimization, by combining some lines of code into one\nfunction, may not give you as much information as you need to look for\n`hot spots' where the code is using a great deal of computer time.\nLikewise, because gcov accumulates statistics by line (at the lowest\nresolution), it works best with a programming style that places only\none statement on each line.  If you use complicated macros that expand\nto loops or to other control structures, the statistics are less\nhelpful---they only report on the line where the macro call appears.\nIf your complex macros behave like functions, you can replace them with\ninline functions to solve this problem.\n\ngcov creates a logfile called sourcefile.gcov which indicates how many\ntimes each line of a source file sourcefile.c has executed.  You can\nuse these logfiles along with gprof to aid in fine-tuning the\nperformance of your programs.  gprof gives timing information you can\nuse along with the information you get from gcov.\n\ngcov works only on code compiled with GCC.  It is not compatible with\nany other profiling or test coverage mechanism."

If only one argument is\nspecified it should refer to a block device or regular file containing\na file system (e.g.  \"/dev/sdb1\" or \"/path/to/disk.img\"). The block\ndevice or image file is then probed for a file system label and other\nmetadata, and is mounted to a directory below /run/media/system/ whose\nname is generated from the file system label. In this mode the block\ndevice or image file must exist at the time of invocation of the\ncommand, so that it may be probed. If the device is found to be a\nremovable block device (e.g. a USB stick) an automount point instead of\na regular mount point is created (i.e. the --automount= option is\nimplied, see below).\n\nIf two arguments are specified the first indicates the mount source\n(the WHAT) and the second indicates the path to mount it on (the\nWHERE). In this mode no probing of the source is attempted, and a\nbacking device node doesn't have to exist yet. However, if this mode is\ncombined with --discover, device node probing for additional metadata\nis enabled, and \u2013 much like in the single-argument case discussed above\n\u2013 the specified device has to exist at the time of invocation of the\ncommand.\n\nUse the --list command to show a terse table of all local, known block\ndevices with file systems that may be mounted with this command.\n\nsystemd-umount can be used to unmount a mount or automount point. It is\nthe same as systemd-mount --umount."

    "command": "screen",
    "description": "screen manager with VT100/ANSI terminal emulation\nScreen is a full-screen window manager that multiplexes a physical\nterminal between several processes (typically interactive shells).\nEach virtual terminal provides the functions of a DEC VT100 terminal\nand, in addition, several control functions from the ISO 6429 (ECMA 48,\nANSI X3.64) and ISO 2022 standards (e.g. insert/delete line and support\nfor multiple character sets).  There is a scrollback history buffer for\neach virtual terminal and a copy-and-paste mechanism that allows moving\ntext regions between windows.\n\nWhen screen is called, it creates a single window with a shell in it\n(or the specified command) and then gets out of your way so that you\ncan use the program as you normally would.  Then, at any time, you can\ncreate new (full-screen) windows with other programs in them (including\nmore shells), kill existing windows, view a list of windows, turn\noutput logging on and off, copy-and-paste text between windows, view\nthe scrollback history, switch between windows in whatever manner you\nwish, etc. All windows run their programs completely independent of\neach other. Programs continue to run when their window is currently not\nvisible and even when the whole screen session is detached from the\nuser's terminal.  When a program terminates, screen (per default) kills\nthe window that contained it.  If this window was in the foreground,\nthe display switches to the previous window; if none are left, screen\nexits. Shells usually distinguish between running as login-shell or\nsub-shell.  Screen runs them as sub-shells, unless told otherwise (See\n\"shell\" .screenrc command).\n\nEverything you type is sent to the program running in the current\nwindow.\tThe only exception to this is the one keystroke that is used\nto initiate a command to the window manager.  By default, each command\nbegins with a control-a (abbreviated C-a from now on), and is followed\nby one other keystroke.\tThe command character and all the key bindings\ncan be fully customized to be anything you like, though they are always\ntwo characters in length.\n\nScreen does not understand the prefix \"C-\" to mean control, although\nthis notation is used in this manual for readability.  Please use the\ncaret notation (\"^A\" instead of \"C-a\") as arguments to e.g. the escape\ncommand or the -e option.  Screen will also print out control\ncharacters in caret notation.\n\nThe standard way to create a new window is to type \"C-a c\".  This\ncreates a new window running a shell and switches to that window\nimmediately, regardless of the state of the process running in the\ncurrent window.\tSimilarly, you can create a new window with a custom\ncommand in it by first binding the command to a keystroke (in your\n.screenrc file or at the \"C-a :\" command line) and then using it just\nlike the \"C-a c\" command.  In addition, new windows can be created by\nrunning a command like:"

The second form is for changing\nmode page fields held on the DEVICE. The third form is for executing\nsome simple SCSI commands. The fourth form (i.e.  the '--inquiry ...\nDEVICE' form) is for fetching and decoding VPD pages from the given\nDEVICE. The --enumerate form is for listing out mode or VPD field data\nheld by this utility (and if a DEVICE is given then it is ignored). The\n--inhex=FN form decodes mode or VPD response data provided in the named\nfile (or from stdin if FN is '-'); that data may either be in\nhexadecimal or binary. The second last form is for Windows only and\nlists the available storage device names; see the OPTIONS entry for\n--wscan. The final form is to provide command line help or the version\nnumber (and date).\n\nIf no options (other than DEVICE) are given then a selection of common\nmode page fields for that device are listed. If the --long option is\nalso given then a description of the fields is placed on the right of\neach line. If the --all option is given then all known mode page fields\nfor that device are listed.

The exit status is the most recently detected error value\n(excluding error value 5 if other errors have been detected). If all\nactions succeed the exit status is zero.\n\nBy default this utility shows mode pages that are common to all\ntransport protocols. These are termed as \"generic\" mode pages.

Electronic software distribution over any network involves\npotential security problems. To help address some of these problems,\nyou can associate digital signatures with the files in a JAR archive.\nDigital signatures allow SSL-enabled clients to perform two important\noperations:\n\n* Confirm the identity of the individual, company, or other entity\nwhose digital signature is associated with the files\n\n* Check whether the files have been tampered with since being signed\n\nIf you have a signing certificate, you can use Netscape Signing Tool to\ndigitally sign files and package them as a JAR file. An object-signing\ncertificate is a special kind of certificate that allows you to\nassociate your digital signature with one or more files.\n\nAn individual file can potentially be signed with multiple digital\nsignatures. For example, a commercial software developer might sign the\nfiles that constitute a software product to prove that the files are\nindeed from a particular company. A network administrator manager might\nsign the same files with an additional digital signature based on a\ncompany-generated certificate to indicate that the product is approved\nfor use within the company.\n\nThe significance of a digital signature is comparable to the\nsignificance of a handwritten signature. Once you have signed a file,\nit is difficult to claim later that you didn't sign it. In some\nsituations, a digital signature may be considered as legally binding as\na handwritten signature. Therefore, you should take great care to\nensure that you can stand behind any file you sign and distribute.\n\nFor example, if you are a software developer, you should test your code\nto make sure it is virus-free before signing it. Similarly, if you are\na network administrator, you should make sure, before signing any code,\nthat it comes from a reliable source and will run correctly with the\nsoftware installed on the machines to which you are distributing it.\n\nBefore you can use Netscape Signing Tool to sign files, you must have\nan object-signing certificate, which is a special certificate whose\nassociated private key is used to create digital signatures. For\ntesting purposes only, you can create an object-signing certificate\nwith Netscape Signing Tool 1.3. When testing is finished and you are\nready to disitribute your software, you should obtain an object-signing\ncertificate from one of two kinds of sources:\n\n* An independent certificate authority (CA) that authenticates your\nidentity and charges you a fee. You typically get a certificate from an\nindependent CA if you want to sign software that will be distributed\nover the Internet.\n\n* CA server software running on your corporate intranet or extranet.\nNetscape Certificate Management System provides a complete management\nsolution for creating, deploying, and managing certificates, including\nCAs that issue object-signing certificates.\n\nYou must also have a certificate for the CA that issues your signing\ncertificate before you can sign files. If the certificate authority's\ncertificate isn't already installed in your copy of Communicator, you\ntypically install it by clicking the appropriate link on the\ncertificate authority's web site, for example on the page from which\nyou initiated enrollment for your signing certificate. This is the case\nfor some test certificates, as well as certificates issued by Netscape\nCertificate Management System: you must download the the CA certificate\nin addition to obtaining your own signing certificate. CA certificates\nfor several certificate authorities are preinstalled in the\nCommunicator certificate database.\n\nWhen you receive an object-signing certificate for your own use, it is\nautomatically installed in your copy of the Communicator client\nsoftware. Communicator supports the public-key cryptography standard\nknown as PKCS #12, which governs key portability. You can, for example,\nmove an object-signing certificate and its associated private key from\none computer to another on a credit-card-sized device called a smart\ncard."

This is provided in the ./doc subdirectory and probably\nin a separate package if you installed rsyslog via a packaging system.\nTo use rsyslog's advanced features, you need to look at the HTML\ndocumentation, because the man pages only covers basic aspects of\noperation.  For details and configuration examples, see the\nrsyslog.conf (5) man page and the online documentation at\nhttps://www.rsyslog.com/doc/\n\nRsyslogd(8) is derived from the sysklogd package which in turn is\nderived from the stock BSD sources.\n\nRsyslogd provides a kind of logging that many modern programs use.\nEvery logged message contains at least a time and a hostname field,\nnormally a program name field, too, but that depends on how trusty the\nlogging program is. The rsyslog package supports free definition of\noutput formats via templates. It also supports precise timestamps and\nwriting directly to databases. If the database option is used, tools\nlike phpLogCon can be used to view the log data.\n\nWhile the rsyslogd sources have been heavily modified a couple of notes\nare in order.  First of all there has been a systematic attempt to\nensure that rsyslogd follows its default, standard BSD behavior. Of\ncourse, some configuration file changes are necessary in order to\nsupport the template system. However, rsyslogd should be able to use a\nstandard syslog.conf and act like the original syslogd. However, an\noriginal syslogd will not work correctly with a rsyslog-enhanced\nconfiguration file. At best, it will generate funny looking file names.\nThe second important concept to note is that this version of rsyslogd\ninteracts transparently with the version of syslog found in the\nstandard libraries.  If a binary linked to the standard shared\nlibraries fails to function correctly we would like an example of the\nanomalous behavior.\n\nThe main configuration file /etc/rsyslog.conf or an alternative file,\ngiven with the -f option, is read at startup.

    "description": "Interactive GUID partition table (GPT) manipulator\nGPT fdisk (aka gdisk) is a text-mode menu-driven program for creation\nand manipulation of partition tables. It will automatically convert an\nold-style Master Boot Record (MBR) partition table or BSD disklabel\nstored without an MBR carrier partition to the newer Globally Unique\nIdentifier (GUID) Partition Table (GPT) format, or will load a GUID\npartition table. When used with the -l command-line option, the program\ndisplays the current partition table and then exits.\n\nGPT fdisk operates mainly on the GPT headers and partition tables;\nhowever, it can and will generate a fresh protective MBR, when\nrequired. (Any boot loader code in the protective MBR will not be\ndisturbed.) If you've created an unusual protective MBR, such as a\nhybrid MBR created by gptsync or gdisk's own hybrid MBR creation\nfeature, this should not be disturbed by most ordinary actions. Some\nadvanced data recovery options require you to understand the\ndistinctions between the main and backup data, as well as between the\nGPT headers and the partition tables. For information on MBR vs. GPT,\nas well as GPT terminology and structure, see the extended gdisk\ndocumentation at http://www.rodsbooks.com/gdisk/ or consult Wikipedia.\n\nThe gdisk program employs a user interface similar to that of Linux's\nfdisk, but gdisk modifies GPT partitions. It also has the capability of\ntransforming MBR partitions or BSD disklabels into GPT partitions. Like\nthe original fdisk program, gdisk does not modify disk structures until\nyou explicitly write them to disk, so if you make a mistake, you can\nexit from the program with the 'q' option to leave your partitions\nunmodified.\n\nOrdinarily, gdisk operates on disk device files, such as /dev/sda or\n/dev/hda under Linux, /dev/disk0 under Mac OS X, or /dev/ad0 or\n/dev/da0 under FreeBSD. The program can also operate on disk image\nfiles, which can be either copies of whole disks (made with dd, for\ninstance) or raw disk images used by emulators such as QEMU or VMWare.\nNote that only raw disk images are supported; gdisk cannot work on\ncompressed or other advanced disk image formats.\n\nThe MBR partitioning system uses a combination of cylinder/head/sector\n(CHS) addressing and logical block addressing (LBA). The former is\nklunky and limiting. GPT drops CHS addressing and uses 64-bit LBA mode\nexclusively. Thus, GPT data structures, and therefore gdisk, do not\nneed to deal with CHS geometries and all the problems they create.\nUsers of fdisk will note that gdisk lacks the options and limitations\nassociated with CHS geometries.\n\nFor best results, you should use an OS-specific partition table program\nwhenever possible. For example, you should make Mac OS X partitions\nwith the Mac OS X Disk Utility program and Linux partitions with the\nLinux gdisk or GNU Parted program.\n\nUpon start, gdisk attempts to identify the partition type in use on the\ndisk. If it finds valid GPT data, gdisk will use it. If gdisk finds a\nvalid MBR or BSD disklabel but no GPT data, it will attempt to convert\nthe MBR or disklabel into GPT form. (BSD disklabels are likely to have\nunusable first and/or final partitions because they overlap with the\nGPT data structures, though.) GPT fdisk can identify, but not use data\nin, Apple Partition Map (APM) disks, which are used on 680x0- and\nPowerPC-based Macintoshes. Upon exiting with the 'w' option, gdisk\nreplaces the MBR or disklabel with a GPT. This action is potentially\ndangerous! Your system may become unbootable, and partition type codes\nmay become corrupted if the disk uses unrecognized type codes. Boot\nproblems are particularly likely if you're multi-booting with any\nGPT-unaware OS. If you mistakenly launch gdisk on an MBR disk, you can\nsafely exit the program without making any changes by using the 'q'\noption.\n\nThe MBR-to-GPT conversion will leave at least one gap in the partition\nnumbering if the original MBR used logical partitions. These gaps are\nharmless, but you can eliminate them by using the 's' option, if you\nlike.  (Doing this may require you to update your /etc/fstab file.)\n\nWhen creating a fresh partition table, certain considerations may be in\norder:\n"

This command must be run from\nwithin that tree.  If the text of the change is given on the command\nline, debchange will run in batch mode and simply add the text, with\nline breaks as necessary, at the appropriate place in debian/changelog\n(or the changelog specified by options, as described below).  If the\ntext given on the command line is a null string, debchange will run in\nbatch mode without adding any text.  If the text given on the command\nline is a space string, debchange will run in batch mode and add a\nblank changelog entry.  If no text is specified then debchange will run\nthe editor as determined by sensible-editor for you to edit the file.\n(The environment variables VISUAL and EDITOR are used in this order to\ndetermine which editor to use.)\tEditors which understand the +n option\nfor starting the editing on a specified line will use this to move to\nthe correct line of the file for editing.  If the editor is quit\nwithout modifying the temporary file, debchange will exit without\ntouching the existing changelog.  Note that the changelog is assumed to\nbe encoded with the UTF-8 encoding.  If it is not, problems may occur.\nPlease see the iconv(1) manpage to find out how to convert changelogs\nfrom legacy encodings.  Finally, a changelog or NEWS file can be\ncreated from scratch using the --create option described below.\n\ndebchange also supports automatically producing bug-closing changelog\nentries, using the --closes option.  This will usually query the BTS,\nthe Debian Bug Tracking System (see https://bugs.debian.org/) to\ndetermine the title of the bug and the package in which it occurs.\nThis behaviour can be stopped by giving a --noquery option or by\nsetting the configuration variable DEBCHANGE_QUERY_BTS to no, as\ndescribed below.  In either case, the editor (as described above) will\nalways be invoked to give an opportunity to modify the entries, and the\nchangelog will be accepted whether or not modifications are made.  An\nextra changelog entry can be given on the command line in addition to\nthe closes entries.\n\nAt most one of --append, --increment, --edit, --release, and\n--newversion may be specified as listed below. If no options are\nspecified, debchange will use heuristics to guess whether or not the\npackage has been successfully released, and behave as if --increment\nhad been specified if the package has been released, or otherwise as if\n--append has been specified.\n\nTwo different sets of heuristics can be used, as controlled by the\n--release-heuristic option or the DEBCHANGE_RELEASE_HEURISTIC\nconfiguration variable. The default changelog heuristic assumes the\npackage has been released unless its changelog contains UNRELEASED in\nthe distribution field. If this heuristic is enabled then the\ndistribution will default to UNRELEASED in new changelog entries, and\nthe --mainttrailer option described below will be automatically\nenabled. This can be useful if a package can be released by different\nmaintainers, or if you do not keep the upload logs. The alternate log\nheuristic determines if a package has been released by looking for an\nappropriate dupload(1) or dput(1) log file in the parent directory.  A\nwarning will be issued if the log file is found but a successful upload\nis not recorded. This may be because the previous upload was performed\nwith a version of dupload prior to 2.1 or because the upload failed.\n\nIf either --increment or --newversion is used, the name and email for\nthe new version will be determined as follows.  If the environment\nvariable DEBFULLNAME is set, this will be used for the maintainer full\nname; if not, then NAME will be checked.  If the environment variable\nDEBEMAIL is set, this will be used for the email address.  If this\nvariable has the form \"name <email>\", then the maintainer name will\nalso be taken from here if neither DEBFULLNAME nor NAME is set.\tIf\nthis variable is not set, the same test is performed on the environment\nvariable EMAIL.\tNext, if the full name has still not been determined,\nthen use getpwuid(3) to determine the name from the password file.  If\nthis fails, use the previous changelog entry.  For the email address,\nif it has not been set from DEBEMAIL or EMAIL, then look in\n/etc/mailname, then attempt to build it from the username and FQDN,\notherwise use the email address in the previous changelog entry.  In\nother words, it's a good idea to set DEBEMAIL and DEBFULLNAME when\nusing this script.\n\nSupport is included for changelogs that record changes by multiple co-\nmaintainers of a package. If an entry is appended to the current\nversion's entries, and the maintainer is different from the maintainer\nwho is listed as having done the previous entries, then lines will be\nadded to the changelog to tell which maintainers made which changes.\nCurrently only one of the several such styles of recording this\ninformation is supported, in which the name of the maintainer who made\na set of changes appears on a line before the changes, inside square\nbrackets. This can be switched on and off using the --[no]multimaint\noption or the DEBCHANGE_MULTIMAINT configuration file option; the\ndefault is to enable it.  Note that if an entry has already been marked\nin this way, then this option will be silently ignored.\n\nIf the directory name of the source tree has the form package-version,\nthen debchange will also attempt to rename it if the (upstream) version\nnumber changes.\tThis can be prevented by using the --preserve command\nline or configuration file option as described below.\n\nIf --force-bad-version or --allow-lower-version is used, debchange will\nnot stop if the new version is less than the current one.  This is\nespecially useful while doing backports."

Hence, if the sparse image file needs to be copied to\nanother location, it should either be compressed first or copied using\nthe --sparse=always option to the GNU version of cp.  This does not\napply to the QCOW2 image, which is not sparse.\n\nThe size of an ext2 image file depends primarily on the size of the\nfilesystems and how many inodes are in use.  For a typical 10 gigabyte\nfilesystem, with 200,000 inodes in use out of 1.2 million inodes, the\nimage file will be approximately 35 megabytes; a 4 gigabyte filesystem\nwith 15,000 inodes in use out of 550,000 inodes will result in a 3\nmegabyte image file.  Image files tend to be quite compressible; an\nimage file taking up 32 megabytes of space on disk will generally\ncompress down to 3 or 4 megabytes."

An\narchive is a single file holding a collection of other files in a\nstructure that makes it possible to retrieve the original individual\nfiles (called members of the archive).\n\nThe original files' contents, mode (permissions), timestamp, owner, and\ngroup are preserved in the archive, and can be restored on extraction.\n\nGNU ar can maintain archives whose members have names of any length;\nhowever, depending on how ar is configured on your system, a limit on\nmember-name length may be imposed for compatibility with archive\nformats maintained with other tools.  If it exists, the limit is often\n15 characters (typical of formats related to a.out) or 16 characters\n(typical of formats related to coff).\n\nar is considered a binary utility because archives of this sort are\nmost often used as libraries holding commonly needed subroutines.\n\nar creates an index to the symbols defined in relocatable object\nmodules in the archive when you specify the modifier s.\tOnce created,\nthis index is updated in the archive whenever ar makes a change to its\ncontents (save for the q update operation).  An archive with such an\nindex speeds up linking to the library, and allows routines in the\nlibrary to call each other without regard to their placement in the\narchive.\n\nYou may use nm -s or nm --print-armap to list this index table.\tIf an\narchive lacks the table, another form of ar called ranlib can be used\nto add just the table.\n\nGNU ar can optionally create a thin archive, which contains a symbol\nindex and references to the original copies of the member files of the\narchive.  This is useful for building libraries for use within a local\nbuild tree, where the relocatable objects are expected to remain\navailable, and copying the contents of each object would only waste\ntime and space.\n\nAn archive can either be thin or it can be normal.  It cannot be both\nat the same time.  Once an archive is created its format cannot be\nchanged without first deleting it and then creating a new archive in\nits place.\n\nThin archives are also flattened, so that adding one thin archive to\nanother thin archive does not nest it, as would happen with a normal\narchive.  Instead the elements of the first archive are added\nindividually to the second archive.\n\nThe paths to the elements of the archive are stored relative to the\narchive itself.\n\nGNU ar is designed to be compatible with two different facilities.  You\ncan control its activity using command-line options, like the different\nvarieties of ar on Unix systems; or, if you specify the single command-\nline option -M, you can control it with a script supplied via standard\ninput, like the MRI \"librarian\" program."

It can be used to send arbitrary\ninformation, encoded in an environment-block-like list of strings. Most\nimportantly, it can be used for start-up completion notification.\n\nThis is mostly just a wrapper around sd_notify() and makes this\nfunctionality available to shell scripts. For details see sd_notify(3).\n\nThe command line may carry a list of environment variables to send as\npart of the status update.\n\nNote that systemd will refuse reception of status updates from this\ncommand unless NotifyAccess= is set for the service unit this command\nis called from.\n\nNote that sd_notify() notifications may be attributed to units\ncorrectly only if either the sending process is still around at the\ntime PID 1 processes the message, or if the sending process is\nexplicitly runtime-tracked by the service manager. The latter is the\ncase if the service manager originally forked off the process, i.e. on\nall processes that match NotifyAccess=main or NotifyAccess=exec.\nConversely, if an auxiliary process of the unit sends an sd_notify()\nmessage and immediately exits, the service manager might not be able to\nproperly attribute the message to the unit, and thus will ignore it,\neven if NotifyAccess=all is set for it.\n\nsystemd-notify will first attempt to invoke sd_notify() pretending to\nhave the PID of the invoking process. This will only succeed when\ninvoked with sufficient privileges. On failure, it will then fall back\nto invoking it under its own PID. This behaviour is useful in order\nthat when the tool is invoked from a shell script the shell process \u2014\nand not the systemd-notify process \u2014 appears as sender of the message,\nwhich in turn is helpful if the shell process is the main process of a\nservice, due to the limitations of NotifyAccess=all described above."

Some RAID levels include redundancy and\nso can survive some degree of device failure.\n\nLinux Software RAID devices are implemented through the md (Multiple\nDevices) device driver.\n\nCurrently, Linux supports LINEAR md devices, RAID0 (striping), RAID1\n(mirroring), RAID4, RAID5, RAID6, RAID10, MULTIPATH, FAULTY, and\nCONTAINER.\n\nMULTIPATH is not a Software RAID mechanism, but does involve multiple\ndevices: each device is a path to one common physical storage device.\nNew installations should not use md/multipath as it is not well\nsupported and has no ongoing development.  Use the Device Mapper based\nmultipath-tools instead.\n\nFAULTY is also not true RAID, and it only involves one device.  It\nprovides a layer over a true device that can be used to inject faults.\n\nCONTAINER is different again.  A CONTAINER is a collection of devices\nthat are managed as a set.  This is similar to the set of devices\nconnected to a hardware RAID controller.  The set of devices may\ncontain a number of different RAID arrays each utilising some (or all)\nof the blocks from a number of the devices in the set.  For example,\ntwo devices in a 5-device set might form a RAID1 using the whole\ndevices.  The remaining three might have a RAID5 over the first half of\neach device, and a RAID0 over the second half.\n\nWith a CONTAINER, there is one set of metadata that describes all of\nthe arrays in the container.

All NTFS versions are supported, used by 32-bit and 64-bit\nWindows.  Defragmentation is NOT required prior to resizing because the\nprogram can relocate any data if needed, without risking data\nintegrity.\n\nNtfsresize can be used to shrink or enlarge any NTFS filesystem located\non an unmounted DEVICE (usually a disk partition). The new filesystem\nwill fit in a DEVICE whose desired size is SIZE bytes.  The SIZE\nparameter may have one of the optional modifiers k, M, G, which means\nthe SIZE parameter is given in kilo-, mega- or gigabytes respectively.\nNtfsresize conforms to the SI, ATA, IEEE standards and the disk\nmanufacturers by using k=10^3, M=10^6 and G=10^9.\n\nIf both --info(-mb-only) and --size are omitted then the NTFS\nfilesystem will be enlarged to match the underlying DEVICE size.\n\nTo resize a filesystem on a partition, you must resize BOTH the\nfilesystem and the partition by editing the partition table on the\ndisk. Similarly to other command line filesystem resizers, ntfsresize\ndoesn't manipulate the size of the partitions, hence to do that you\nmust use a disk partitioning tool as well, for example fdisk(8).\nAlternatively you could use one of the many user friendly partitioners\nthat uses ntfsresize internally, like Mandriva's DiskDrake, QTParted,\nSUSE/Novell's YaST Partitioner, IBM's EVMS, GParted or Debian/Ubuntu's\nPartman.\n\nIMPORTANT!  It's a good practice making REGULAR BACKUPS of your\nvaluable data, especially before using ANY partitioning tools. To do so\nfor NTFS, you could use ntfsclone(8).  Don't forget to save the\npartition table as well!\n\nShrinkage\nIf you wish to shrink an NTFS partition, first use ntfsresize to shrink\nthe size of the filesystem. Then you could use fdisk(8) to shrink the\nsize of the partition by deleting the partition and recreating it with\nthe smaller size.  Do not make the partition smaller than the new size\nof NTFS otherwise you won't be able to boot. If you did so\nnotwithstanding then just recreate the partition to be as large as\nNTFS.\n\nEnlargement\nTo enlarge an NTFS filesystem, first you must enlarge the size of the\nunderlying partition. This can be done using fdisk(8) by deleting the\npartition and recreating it with a larger size.\tMake sure it will not\noverlap with another existing partition.  You may enlarge upwards\n(first sector unchanged) or downwards (last sector unchanged), but you\nmay not enlarge at both ends in a single step.  If you merge two NTFS\npartitions, only one of them can be expanded to the merged partition.\nAfter you have enlarged the partition, you may use ntfsresize to\nenlarge the size of the filesystem.\n\nPartitioning\nWhen recreating the partition by a disk partitioning tool, make sure\nyou create it at the same starting sector and with the same partition\ntype as before.\tOtherwise you won't be able to access your filesystem.\nUse the 'u' fdisk command to switch to the reliable sector unit from\nthe default cylinder one.\n\nAlso make sure you set the bootable flag for the partition if it\nexisted before. Failing to do so you might not be able to boot your\ncomputer from the disk."

(Modern Linux 2.6 kernels will support on-\nline resize for file systems mounted using ext3 and ext4; ext3 file\nsystems will require the use of file systems with the resize_inode\nfeature enabled.)\n\nThe size parameter specifies the requested new size of the filesystem.\nIf no units are specified, the units of the size parameter shall be the\nfilesystem blocksize of the filesystem.\tOptionally, the size parameter\nmay be suffixed by one of the following units designators: 'K', 'M',\n'G', 'T' (either upper-case or lower-case) or 's' for power-of-two\nkilobytes, megabytes, gigabytes, terabytes or 512 byte sectors\nrespectively. The size of the filesystem may never be larger than the\nsize of the partition.  If size parameter is not specified, it will\ndefault to the size of the partition.\n\nThe resize2fs program does not manipulate the size of partitions.  If\nyou wish to enlarge a filesystem, you must make sure you can expand the\nsize of the underlying partition first.\tThis can be done using\nfdisk(8) by deleting the partition and recreating it with a larger size\nor using lvextend(8), if you're using the logical volume manager\nlvm(8).\tWhen recreating the partition, make sure you create it with\nthe same starting disk cylinder as before!  Otherwise, the resize\noperation will certainly not work, and you may lose your entire\nfilesystem.  After running fdisk(8), run resize2fs to resize the ext2\nfilesystem to use all of the space in the newly enlarged partition.\n\nIf you wish to shrink an ext2 partition, first use resize2fs to shrink\nthe size of filesystem.\tThen you may use fdisk(8) to shrink the size\nof the partition.  When shrinking the size of the partition, make sure\nyou do not make it smaller than the new size of the ext2 filesystem!\n\nThe -b and -s options enable and disable the 64bit feature,\nrespectively.  The resize2fs program will, of course, take care of\nresizing the block group descriptors and moving other data blocks out\nof the way, as needed.  It is not possible to resize the filesystem\nconcurrent with changing the 64bit status."

    "description": "Update Configuration File:  preserve user changes in\nconfiguration files\nThis utility provides a means of asking the user whether or not to\naccept new versions of configuration files provided by the package\nmaintainer, with various heuristics designed to minimize interaction\ntime. It uses debconf to interact with the user, as per Debian policy.\nIn the SYNOPSIS above, New file is the configuration file as provided\nby the package (either shipped with the package, or generated by the\nmaintainer scripts on the fly), and Destination is the location\n(usually under /etc) where the real configuration file lives, and is\npotentially modified by the end user.  Since the files edited would be\nreal files, and not symbolic links, ucf follows and resolves symbolic\nlinks before acting. As far as possible, ucf attempts to preserve the\nownership and permission of the New file as it is copied to the new\nlocation.\n\nThis script attempts to provide conffile like handling for files\ninstalled under /etc not shipped in a Debian package, but handled by\nthe postinst instead.  Debian policy states that files under /etc which\nare configuration files must preserve user changes, and this applies to\nfiles handled by maintainer scripts as well. Using ucf, one may ship a\nbunch of default configuration files somewhere in /usr (\n/usr/share/<pkg> is a good location), and maintain files in /etc,\npreserving user changes and in general offering the same facilities\nwhile upgrading that dpkg normally provides for \u201cconffiles\u201d\n\nAdditionally, this script provides facilities for transitioning a file\nthat had not been provided conffile like protection to come under this\nschema, and attempts to minimize questions asked at install time.\nIndeed, the transitioning facility is better than the one offered by\ndpkg while transitioning a file from a non-conffile to conffile status.\nThe second form in the SYNOPSIS above is for purging information about\nthe configuration file when the package is purged; and is critical for\nallowing smooth reinstallations.\n\nDuring the course of operations, when working with configuration files,\nucf optionally creates copies of versions of the configuration file in\nquestion. For example, a file with the suffix ucf-old holds the old\nversion of a configuration file replaced by ucf.  Also, copies of the\nconfiguration file with the suffixes ucf-new and ucf-dist may be\ncreated; and the maintainer scripts should consider purging copies of\nthe configuration file with these extensions during purge."

It is also extremely modular so you can easily include or\nexclude commands (or features) at compile time. This makes it easy to\ncustomize your embedded systems. To create a working system, just add\n/dev, /etc, and a Linux kernel.\tBusyBox provides a fairly complete\nPOSIX environment for any small or embedded system.\n\nBusyBox is extremely configurable.  This allows you to include only the\ncomponents you need, thereby reducing binary size. Run 'make config' or\n'make menuconfig' to select the functionality that you wish to enable.\nThen run 'make' to compile BusyBox using your configuration.\n\nAfter the compile has finished, you should use 'make install' to\ninstall BusyBox. This will install the 'bin/busybox' binary, in the\ntarget directory specified by CONFIG_PREFIX. CONFIG_PREFIX can be set\nwhen configuring BusyBox, or you can specify an alternative location at\ninstall time (i.e., with a command line like 'make\nCONFIG_PREFIX=/tmp/foo install'). If you enabled any applet\ninstallation scheme (either as symlinks or hardlinks), these will also\nbe installed in the location pointed to by CONFIG_PREFIX."

In compat 11 and\nlater, it also supports the default searchdir plus --sourcedir like\ndh_install(1) and has the advantage that it respects the nodoc build\nprofile (unlike dh_install(1)).\n\nEven if you prefer to use dh_install(1) for installing the manpages,\ndh_installman can still be useful for converting the manpage encoding\nto UTF-8 and for converting .so links (as described below).  However,\nthat part happens automatically without any explicit configuration.\n\nYou tell dh_installman what man pages go in your packages, and it\nfigures out where to install them based on the section field in their\n.TH or .Dt line. If you have a properly formatted .TH or .Dt line, your\nman page will be installed into the right directory, with the right\nname (this includes proper handling of pages with a subsection, like\n3perl, which are placed in man3, and given an extension of .3perl). If\nyour .TH or .Dt line is incorrect or missing, the program may guess\nwrong based on the file extension.\n\nIt also supports translated man pages, by looking for extensions like\n.ll.8 and .ll_LL.8, or by use of the --language switch.\n\nIf dh_installman seems to install a man page into the wrong section or\nwith the wrong extension, this is because the man page has the wrong\nsection listed in its .TH or .Dt line. Edit the man page and correct\nthe section, and dh_installman will follow suit. See man(7) for details\nabout the .TH section, and mdoc(7) for the .Dt section. If\ndh_installman seems to install a man page into a directory like\n/usr/share/man/pl/man1/, that is because your program has a name like\nfoo.pl, and dh_installman assumes that means it is translated into\nPolish. Use --language=C to avoid this.\n\nAfter the man page installation step, dh_installman will check to see\nif any of the man pages in the temporary directories of any of the\npackages it is acting on contain .so links. If so, it changes them to\nsymlinks.\n\nAlso, dh_installman will use man to guess the character encoding of\neach manual page and convert it to UTF-8. If the guesswork fails for\nsome reason, you can override it using an encoding declaration. See\nmanconv(1) for details.\n\nFrom debhelper compatibility level 11 on, dh_install will fall back to\nlooking in debian/tmp for files, if it does not find them in the\ncurrent directory (or wherever you've told it to look using\n--sourcedir)."

The canonical example of this is a binary executable (compiled\nprogram) a.out file, whose format is defined in <elf.h>, <a.out.h> and\npossibly <exec.h> in the standard include directory.  These files have a\n\u201cmagic number\u201d stored in a particular place near the beginning of the\nfile that tells the UNIX operating system that the file is a binary\nexecutable, and which of several types thereof.  The concept of a \u201cmagic\u201d\nhas been applied by extension to data files.  Any file with some\ninvariant identifier at a small fixed offset into the file can usually be\ndescribed in this way.  The information identifying these files is read\nfrom /etc/magic and the compiled magic file /usr/share/misc/magic.mgc, or\nthe files in the directory /usr/share/misc/magic if the compiled file\ndoes not exist.  In addition, if $HOME/.magic.mgc or $HOME/.magic exists,\nit will be used in preference to the system magic files.\n\nIf a file does not match any of the entries in the magic file, it is\nexamined to see if it seems to be a text file.  ASCII, ISO-8859-x, non-\nISO 8-bit extended-ASCII character sets (such as those used on Macintosh\nand IBM PC systems), UTF-8-encoded Unicode, UTF-16-encoded Unicode, and\nEBCDIC character sets can be distinguished by the different ranges and\nsequences of bytes that constitute printable text in each set.  If a file\npasses any of these tests, its character set is reported.\tASCII,\nISO-8859-x, UTF-8, and extended-ASCII files are identified as \u201ctext\u201d\nbecause they will be mostly readable on nearly any terminal; UTF-16 and\nEBCDIC are only \u201ccharacter data\u201d because, while they contain text, it is\ntext that will require translation before it can be read.\tIn addition,\nfile will attempt to determine other characteristics of text-type files.\nIf the lines of a file are terminated by CR, CRLF, or NEL, instead of the\nUnix-standard LF, this will be reported.  Files that contain embedded\nescape sequences or overstriking will also be identified.\n\nOnce file has determined the character set used in a text-type file, it\nwill attempt to determine in what language the file is written.  The\nlanguage tests look for particular strings (cf.  <names.h>) that can\nappear anywhere in the first few blocks of a file.  For example, the\nkeyword .br indicates that the file is most likely a troff(1) input file,\njust as the keyword struct indicates a C program.\tThese tests are less\nreliable than the previous two groups, so they are performed last.  The\nlanguage test routines also test for some miscellany (such as tar(1)\narchives, JSON files).\n\nAny file that cannot be identified as having been written in any of the\ncharacter sets listed above is simply said to be \u201cdata\u201d."

    "description": "maintain symbolic links determining default\ncommands\nupdate-alternatives creates, removes, maintains and displays\ninformation about the symbolic links comprising the Debian alternatives\nsystem.\n\nIt is possible for several programs fulfilling the same or similar\nfunctions to be installed on a single system at the same time.  For\nexample, many systems have several text editors installed at once.\nThis gives choice to the users of a system, allowing each to use a\ndifferent editor, if desired, but makes it difficult for a program to\nmake a good choice for an editor to invoke if the user has not\nspecified a particular preference.\n\nDebian's alternatives system aims to solve this problem.  A generic\nname in the filesystem is shared by all files providing interchangeable\nfunctionality.  The alternatives system and the system administrator\ntogether determine which actual file is referenced by this generic\nname.  For example, if the text editors ed(1) and nvi(1) are both\ninstalled on the system, the alternatives system will cause the generic\nname /usr/bin/editor to refer to /usr/bin/nvi by default. The system\nadministrator can override this and cause it to refer to /usr/bin/ed\ninstead, and the alternatives system will not alter this setting until\nexplicitly requested to do so.\n\nThe generic name is not a direct symbolic link to the selected\nalternative.  Instead, it is a symbolic link to a name in the\nalternatives directory, which in turn is a symbolic link to the actual\nfile referenced.  This is done so that the system administrator's\nchanges can be confined within the /etc directory: the FHS (q.v.) gives\nreasons why this is a Good Thing.\n\nWhen each package providing a file with a particular functionality is\ninstalled, changed or removed, update-alternatives is called to update\ninformation about that file in the alternatives system.\nupdate-alternatives is usually called from the postinst (configure) or\nprerm (remove and deconfigure) scripts in Debian packages.\n\nIt is often useful for a number of alternatives to be synchronized, so\nthat they are changed as a group; for example, when several versions of\nthe vi(1) editor are installed, the man page referenced by\n/usr/share/man/man1/vi.1 should correspond to the executable referenced\nby /usr/bin/vi.\tupdate-alternatives handles this by means of master\nand slave links; when the master is changed, any associated slaves are\nchanged too.  A master link and its associated slaves make up a link\ngroup.\n\nEach link group is, at any given time, in one of two modes: automatic\nor manual.  When a group is in automatic mode, the alternatives system\nwill automatically decide, as packages are installed and removed,\nwhether and how to update the links.  In manual mode, the alternatives\nsystem will retain the choice of the administrator and avoid changing\nthe links (except when something is broken).\n\nLink groups are in automatic mode when they are first introduced to the\nsystem.\tIf the system administrator makes changes to the system's\nautomatic settings, this will be noticed the next time\nupdate-alternatives is run on the changed link's group, and the group\nwill automatically be switched to manual mode.\n\nEach alternative has a priority associated with it.  When a link group\nis in automatic mode, the alternatives pointed to by members of the\ngroup will be those which have the highest priority.\n\nWhen using the --config option, update-alternatives will list all of\nthe choices for the link group of which given name is the master\nalternative name.  The current choice is marked with a \u2018*\u2019.  You will\nthen be prompted for your choice regarding this link group.  Depending\non the choice made, the link group might no longer be in auto mode. You\nwill need to use the --auto option in order to return to the automatic\nmode (or you can rerun --config and select the entry marked as\nautomatic).\n\nIf you want to configure non-interactively you can use the --set option\ninstead (see below).\n\nDifferent packages providing the same file need to do so cooperatively.\nIn other words, the usage of update-alternatives is mandatory for all\ninvolved packages in such case. It is not possible to override some\nfile in a package that does not employ the update-alternatives\nmechanism."

The current\nversion of dash is in the process of being changed to conform with the\nPOSIX 1003.2 and 1003.2a specifications for the shell.  This version has\nmany features which make it appear similar in some respects to the Korn\nshell, but it is not a Korn shell clone (see ksh(1)).  Only features\ndesignated by POSIX, plus a few Berkeley extensions, are being\nincorporated into this shell.  This man page is not intended to be a\ntutorial or a complete specification of the shell.\n\nOverview\nThe shell is a command that reads lines from either a file or the\nterminal, interprets them, and generally executes other commands.\tIt is\nthe program that is running when a user logs into the system (although a\nuser can select a different shell with the chsh(1) command).  The shell\nimplements a language that has flow control constructs, a macro facility\nthat provides a variety of features in addition to data storage, along\nwith built in history and line editing capabilities.  It incorporates\nmany features to aid interactive use and has the advantage that the\ninterpretative language is common to both interactive and non-interactive\nuse (shell scripts).  That is, commands can be typed directly to the\nrunning shell or can be put into a file and the file can be executed\ndirectly by the shell.\n\nInvocation\nIf no args are present and if the standard input of the shell is\nconnected to a terminal (or if the -i flag is set), and the -c option is\nnot present, the shell is considered an interactive shell.  An\ninteractive shell generally prompts before each command and handles\nprogramming and command errors differently (as described below).  When\nfirst starting, the shell inspects argument 0, and if it begins with a\ndash \u2018-\u2019, the shell is also considered a login shell.  This is normally\ndone automatically by the system when the user first logs in.  A login\nshell first reads commands from the files /etc/profile and .profile if\nthey exist.  If the environment variable ENV is set on entry to an\ninteractive shell, or is set in the .profile of a login shell, the shell\nnext reads commands from the file named in ENV.  Therefore, a user should\nplace commands that are to be executed only at login time in the .profile\nfile, and commands that are executed for every interactive shell inside\nthe ENV file.  To set the ENV variable to some file, place the following\nline in your .profile of your home directory"

(The default extension is z for MSDOS, OS/2 FAT,\nWindows NT FAT and Atari.)  If no files are specified, or if a file\nname is \"-\", the standard input is compressed to the standard output.\nGzip will only attempt to compress regular files.  In particular, it\nwill ignore symbolic links.\n\nIf the compressed file name is too long for its file system, gzip\ntruncates it.  Gzip attempts to truncate only the parts of the file\nname longer than 3 characters.  (A part is delimited by dots.) If the\nname consists of small parts only, the longest parts are truncated. For\nexample, if file names are limited to 14 characters, gzip.msdos.exe is\ncompressed to gzi.msd.exe.gz.  Names are not truncated on systems which\ndo not have a limit on file name length.\n\nBy default, gzip keeps the original file name and timestamp in the\ncompressed file. These are used when decompressing the file with the -N\noption. This is useful when the compressed file name was truncated or\nwhen the timestamp was not preserved after a file transfer.\n\nCompressed files can be restored to their original form using gzip -d\nor gunzip or zcat.  If the original name saved in the compressed file\nis not suitable for its file system, a new name is constructed from the\noriginal one to make it legal.\n\ngunzip takes a list of files on its command line and replaces each file\nwhose name ends with .gz, -gz, .z, -z, or _z (ignoring case) and which\nbegins with the correct magic number with an uncompressed file without\nthe original extension.\tgunzip also recognizes the special extensions\n.tgz and .taz as shorthands for .tar.gz and .tar.Z respectively.  When\ncompressing, gzip uses the .tgz extension if necessary instead of\ntruncating a file with a .tar extension.\n\ngunzip can currently decompress files created by gzip, zip, compress,\ncompress -H or pack.  The detection of the input format is automatic.\nWhen using the first two formats, gunzip checks a 32 bit CRC. For pack\nand gunzip checks the uncompressed length. The standard compress format\nwas not designed to allow consistency checks. However gunzip is\nsometimes able to detect a bad .Z file. If you get an error when\nuncompressing a .Z file, do not assume that the .Z file is correct\nsimply because the standard uncompress does not complain. This\ngenerally means that the standard uncompress does not check its input,\nand happily generates garbage output.  The SCO compress -H format (lzh\ncompression method) does not include a CRC but also allows some\nconsistency checks.\n\nFiles created by zip can be uncompressed by gzip only if they have a\nsingle member compressed with the 'deflation' method. This feature is\nonly intended to help conversion of tar.zip files to the tar.gz format.\nTo extract a zip file with a single member, use a command like gunzip\n<foo.zip or gunzip -S .zip foo.zip.  To extract zip files with several\nmembers, use unzip instead of gunzip.\n\nzcat is identical to gunzip -c.\t(On some systems, zcat may be\ninstalled as gzcat to preserve the original link to compress.)  zcat\nuncompresses either a list of files on the command line or its standard\ninput and writes the uncompressed data on standard output.  zcat will\nuncompress files that have the correct magic number whether they have a\n.gz suffix or not.\n\nGzip uses the Lempel-Ziv algorithm used in zip and PKZIP.  The amount\nof compression obtained depends on the size of the input and the\ndistribution of common substrings.  Typically, text such as source code\nor English is reduced by 60-70%.  Compression is generally much better\nthan that achieved by LZW (as used in compress), Huffman coding (as\nused in pack), or adaptive Huffman coding (compact).\n\nCompression is always performed, even if the compressed file is\nslightly larger than the original. The worst case expansion is a few\nbytes for the gzip file header, plus 5 bytes every 32K block, or an\nexpansion ratio of 0.015% for large files. Note that the actual number\nof used disk blocks almost never increases.  gzip preserves the mode,\nownership and timestamps of files when compressing or decompressing."

    "command": "x11perf",
    "description": "X11 server performance test program\nThe x11perf program runs one or more performance tests and reports how\nfast an X server can execute the tests.\n\nMany graphics benchmarks assume that the graphics device is used to\ndisplay the output of a single fancy graphics application, and that the\nuser gets his work done on some other device, like a terminal.  Such\nbenchmarks usually measure drawing speed for lines, polygons, text,\netc.\n\nSince workstations are not used as standalone graphics engines, but as\nsuper-terminals, x11perf measures window management performance as well\nas traditional graphics performance.  x11perf includes benchmarks for\nthe time it takes to create and map windows (as when you start up an\napplication); to map a pre-existing set of windows onto the screen (as\nwhen you deiconify an application or pop up a menu); and to rearrange\nwindows (as when you slosh windows to and fro trying to find the one\nyou want).\n\nx11perf also measures graphics performance for operations not normally\nused in standalone graphics displays, but are nonetheless used\nfrequently by X applications.  Such operations include CopyPlane (used\nto map bitmaps into pixels), scrolling (used in text windows), and\nvarious stipples and tiles (used for CAD and color half-toning,\nrespectively).\n\nx11perf should be used to analyze particular strengths and weaknesses\nof servers, and is most useful to a server writer who wants to analyze\nand improve a server.  x11perf is meant to comprehensively exercise\njust about every X11 operation you can perform; it does not purport to\nbe a representative sample of the operations that X11 applications\nactually use.  While it can be used as a benchmark, it was written and\nis intended as a performance testing tool.\n\nAs such, x11perf DOES NOT whittle down measurements to a single\n``HeXStones'' or ``MeXops'' number.  We consider such numbers to be\nuninformative at best and misleading at worst.  Some servers which are\nvery fast for certain applications can be very slow for others.\tNo\nsingle number or small set of numbers are sufficient to characterize\nhow an X implementation will perform on all applications.  However, by\nknowledge of your favorite application, you may be able to use the\nnumbers x11perf reports to predict its performance on a given X\nimplementation.\n\nThat said, you might also want to look at x11perfcomp(1), a program to\ncompare the outputs of different x11perf runs.  You provide a list of\nfiles containing results from x11perf, and it lays them out in a nice\ntabular format.\n\nFor repeatable results, x11perf should be run using a local connection\non a freshly-started server.  The default configuration runs each test\n5 times, in order to see if each trial takes approximately the same\namount of time.\tStrange glitches should be examined; if non-repeatable\none might chalk them up to daemons and network traffic.\tEach trial is\nrun for 5 seconds, in order to reduce random time differences.  The\nnumber of objects processed per second is displayed to 3 significant\ndigits, but you'll be lucky on most UNIX system if the numbers are\nactually consistent to 2 digits.  x11perf moves the cursor out of the\ntest window; you should be careful not to bump the mouse and move it\nback into the window.  (A prize to people who correctly explain why!!).\n\nBefore running a test, x11perf determines what the round trip time to\nthe server is, and factors this out of the final timing reported.  It\nensures that the server has actually performed the work requested by\nfetching a pixel back from the test window, which means that servers\ntalking to graphics accelerators can't claim that they are done, while\nin the meantime the accelerator is painting madly.\n\nBy default x11perf automatically calibrates the number of repetitions\nof each test, so that each should take approximately the same length of\ntime to run across servers of widely differing speeds.  However, since\neach test must be run to completion at least once, some slow servers\nmay take a very long time, particularly on the window moving and\nresizing tests, and on the arc drawing tests.\n\nAll timing reports are for the smallest object involved.  For example,\nthe line tests use a PolyLine request to paint several lines at once,\nbut report how many lines per second the server can paint, not how many\nPolyLine requests per second.  Text tests paint a line of characters,\nbut report on the number of characters per second.  Some window tests\nmap, unmap, or move a single parent window, but report on how many\nchildren windows per second the server can map, unmap, or move.\n\nThe current program is mostly the responsibility of Joel McCormack.  It\nis based upon the x11perf developed by Phil Karlton, Susan Angebranndt,\nChris Kent, Mary Walker, and Todd Newman, who wanted to assess\nperformance differences between various servers.  Several tests were\nadded  in order to write and tune the PMAX (DECStation 3100) servers.\nFor a general release to the world, x11perf was rewritten to ease\nmaking comparisons between widely varying machines, to cover most\nimportant (and unimportant) X functionality, and to exercise graphics\noperations in as many different orientations and alignments as\npossible."

The user has only one chance to enter the correct password.\nThe superuser is permitted to bypass this step so that forgotten\npasswords may be changed.\n\nAfter the password has been entered, password aging information is\nchecked to see if the user is permitted to change the password at this\ntime. If not, passwd refuses to change the password and exits.\n\nThe user is then prompted twice for a replacement password. The second\nentry is compared against the first and both are required to match in\norder for the password to be changed.\n\nThen, the password is tested for complexity. As a general guideline,\npasswords should consist of 6 to 8 characters including one or more\ncharacters from each of the following sets:\n\n\u2022   lower case alphabetics\n\n\u2022   digits 0 thru 9\n\n\u2022   punctuation marks\n\nCare must be taken not to include the system default erase or kill\ncharacters.  passwd will reject any password which is not suitably\ncomplex.\n\nHints for user passwords\nThe security of a password depends upon the strength of the encryption\nalgorithm and the size of the key space. The legacy UNIX System\nencryption method is based on the NBS DES algorithm. More recent\nmethods are now recommended (see ENCRYPT_METHOD). The size of the key\nspace depends upon the randomness of the password which is selected.\n\nCompromises in password security normally result from careless password\nselection or handling. For this reason, you should not select a\npassword which appears in a dictionary or which must be written down.\nThe password should also not be a proper name, your license number,\nbirth date, or street address. Any of these may be used as guesses to\nviolate system security.\n\nYou can find advice on how to choose a strong password on\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_strength"

This file contains the\nlist of jobs that Anacron controls.  Each job entry specifies a period\nin days, a delay in minutes, a unique job identifier, and a shell\ncommand.\n\nFor each job, Anacron checks whether this job has been executed in the\nlast n days, where n is the period specified for that job.  If not,\nAnacron runs the job's shell command, after waiting for the number of\nminutes specified as the delay parameter.\n\nAfter the command exits, Anacron records the date in a special\ntimestamp file for that job, so it can know when to execute it again.\nOnly the date is used for the time calculations.  The hour is not used.\n\nWhen there are no more jobs to be run, Anacron exits.\n\nAnacron only considers jobs whose identifier, as specified in the\nanacrontab matches any of the job command-line arguments.

Specifying no job arguments, is\nequivalent to specifying \"*\"  (That is, all jobs will be considered).\n\nUnless the -d option is given (see below), Anacron forks to the\nbackground when it starts, and the parent process exits immediately.\n\nUnless the -s or -n options are given, Anacron starts jobs immediately\nwhen their delay is over.  The execution of different jobs is\ncompletely independent.\n\nIf a job generates any output on its standard output or standard error,\nthe output is mailed to the user running Anacron (usually root), or to\nthe address contained by the MAILTO environment variable in the\ncrontab, if such exists.\n\nInformative messages about what Anacron is doing are sent to syslogd(8)\nunder facility cron, priority notice.

There is\nactually only one main program; the specific layout algorithms are\nimplemented as plugins. Thus, they largely share all of the same\ncommand-line options.\n\ndot draws directed graphs.  It works well on directed acyclic graphs\nand other graphs that can be drawn as hierarchies or have a natural\n``flow.''\n\nneato draws undirected graphs using a ``spring'' model and reducing the\nrelated energy (see Kamada and Kawai, Information Processing Letters\n31:1, April 1989).\n\ntwopi draws graphs using a radial layout (see G. Wills, Symposium on\nGraph Drawing GD'97, September, 1997).  Basically, one node is chosen\nas the center and put at the origin.  The remaining nodes are placed on\na sequence of concentric circles centered about the origin, each a\nfixed radial distance from the previous circle.\tAll nodes distance 1\nfrom the center are placed on the first circle; all nodes distance 1\nfrom a node on the first circle are placed on the second circle; and so\nforth.\n\ncirco draws graphs using a circular layout (see Six and Tollis, GD '99\nand ALENEX '99, and Kaufmann and Wiese, GD '02.)  The tool identifies\nbiconnected components and draws the nodes of the component on a\ncircle. The block\u2010cutpoint tree is then laid out using a recursive\nradial algorithm. Edge crossings within a circle are minimized by\nplacing as many edges on the circle's perimeter as possible.  In\nparticular, if the component is outerplanar, the component will have a\nplanar layout.  If a node belongs to multiple non\u2010trivial biconnected\ncomponents, the layout puts the node in one of them. By default, this\nis the first non\u2010trivial component found in the search from the root\ncomponent.\n\nfdp draws undirected graphs using a ``spring'' model.

(The default extension is z for MSDOS, OS/2 FAT,\nWindows NT FAT and Atari.)  If no files are specified, or if a file\nname is \"-\", the standard input is compressed to the standard output.\nGzip will only attempt to compress regular files.  In particular, it\nwill ignore symbolic links.\n\nIf the compressed file name is too long for its file system, gzip\ntruncates it.  Gzip attempts to truncate only the parts of the file\nname longer than 3 characters.  (A part is delimited by dots.) If the\nname consists of small parts only, the longest parts are truncated. For\nexample, if file names are limited to 14 characters, gzip.msdos.exe is\ncompressed to gzi.msd.exe.gz.  Names are not truncated on systems which\ndo not have a limit on file name length.\n\nBy default, gzip keeps the original file name and timestamp in the\ncompressed file. These are used when decompressing the file with the -N\noption. This is useful when the compressed file name was truncated or\nwhen the timestamp was not preserved after a file transfer.\n\nCompressed files can be restored to their original form using gzip -d\nor gunzip or zcat.  If the original name saved in the compressed file\nis not suitable for its file system, a new name is constructed from the\noriginal one to make it legal.\n\ngunzip takes a list of files on its command line and replaces each file\nwhose name ends with .gz, -gz, .z, -z, or _z (ignoring case) and which\nbegins with the correct magic number with an uncompressed file without\nthe original extension.\tgunzip also recognizes the special extensions\n.tgz and .taz as shorthands for .tar.gz and .tar.Z respectively.  When\ncompressing, gzip uses the .tgz extension if necessary instead of\ntruncating a file with a .tar extension.\n\ngunzip can currently decompress files created by gzip, zip, compress,\ncompress -H or pack.  The detection of the input format is automatic.\nWhen using the first two formats, gunzip checks a 32 bit CRC. For pack\nand gunzip checks the uncompressed length. The standard compress format\nwas not designed to allow consistency checks. However gunzip is\nsometimes able to detect a bad .Z file. If you get an error when\nuncompressing a .Z file, do not assume that the .Z file is correct\nsimply because the standard uncompress does not complain. This\ngenerally means that the standard uncompress does not check its input,\nand happily generates garbage output.  The SCO compress -H format (lzh\ncompression method) does not include a CRC but also allows some\nconsistency checks.\n\nFiles created by zip can be uncompressed by gzip only if they have a\nsingle member compressed with the 'deflation' method. This feature is\nonly intended to help conversion of tar.zip files to the tar.gz format.\nTo extract a zip file with a single member, use a command like gunzip\n<foo.zip or gunzip -S .zip foo.zip.  To extract zip files with several\nmembers, use unzip instead of gunzip.\n\nzcat is identical to gunzip -c.\t(On some systems, zcat may be\ninstalled as gzcat to preserve the original link to compress.)  zcat\nuncompresses either a list of files on the command line or its standard\ninput and writes the uncompressed data on standard output.  zcat will\nuncompress files that have the correct magic number whether they have a\n.gz suffix or not.\n\nGzip uses the Lempel-Ziv algorithm used in zip and PKZIP.  The amount\nof compression obtained depends on the size of the input and the\ndistribution of common substrings.  Typically, text such as source code\nor English is reduced by 60-70%.  Compression is generally much better\nthan that achieved by LZW (as used in compress), Huffman coding (as\nused in pack), or adaptive Huffman coding (compact).\n\nCompression is always performed, even if the compressed file is\nslightly larger than the original. The worst case expansion is a few\nbytes for the gzip file header, plus 5 bytes every 32K block, or an\nexpansion ratio of 0.015% for large files. Note that the actual number\nof used disk blocks almost never increases.  gzip preserves the mode,\nownership and timestamps of files when compressing or decompressing."

Each file system in this table is referred\nto as an exported file system, or export, for short.\n\nEach file system in the export table has an access control list.\nrpc.mountd uses these access control lists to determine whether an NFS\nclient is permitted to access a given file system.  For details on how\nto manage your NFS server's export table, see the exports(5) and\nexportfs(8) man pages.\n\nMounting exported NFS File Systems\nThe NFS MOUNT protocol has several procedures.  The most important of\nthese are MNT (mount an export) and UMNT (unmount an export).\n\nA MNT request has two arguments: an explicit argument that contains the\npathname of the root directory of the export to be mounted, and an\nimplicit argument that is the sender's IP address.\n\nWhen receiving a MNT request from an NFS client, rpc.mountd checks both\nthe pathname and the sender's IP address against its export table.  If\nthe sender is permitted to access the requested export, rpc.mountd\nreturns an NFS file handle for the export's root directory to the\nclient.\tThe client can then use the root file handle and NFS LOOKUP\nrequests to navigate the directory structure of the export.\n\nThe rmtab File\nThe rpc.mountd daemon registers every successful MNT request by adding\nan entry to the /var/lib/nfs/rmtab file.  When receivng a UMNT request\nfrom an NFS client, rpc.mountd simply removes the matching entry from\n/var/lib/nfs/rmtab, as long as the access control list for that export\nallows that sender to access the export.\n\nClients can discover the list of file systems an NFS server is\ncurrently exporting, or the list of other clients that have mounted its\nexports, by using the showmount(8) command.  showmount(8) uses other\nprocedures in the NFS MOUNT protocol to report information about the\nserver's exported file systems.\n\nNote, however, that there is little to guarantee that the contents of\n/var/lib/nfs/rmtab are accurate.  A client may continue accessing an\nexport even after invoking UMNT.  If the client reboots without sending\na UMNT request, stale entries remain for that client in\n/var/lib/nfs/rmtab."

It is called a macro processor because it allows you to\ndefine macros, which are brief abbreviations for longer constructs.\n\nThe C preprocessor is intended to be used only with C, C++, and\nObjective-C source code.  In the past, it has been abused as a general\ntext processor.\tIt will choke on input which does not obey C's lexical\nrules.  For example, apostrophes will be interpreted as the beginning\nof character constants, and cause errors.  Also, you cannot rely on it\npreserving characteristics of the input which are not significant to\nC-family languages.  If a Makefile is preprocessed, all the hard tabs\nwill be removed, and the Makefile will not work.\n\nHaving said that, you can often get away with using cpp on things which\nare not C.  Other Algol-ish programming languages are often safe (Ada,\netc.) So is assembly, with caution.  -traditional-cpp mode preserves\nmore white space, and is otherwise more permissive.  Many of the\nproblems can be avoided by writing C or C++ style comments instead of\nnative language comments, and keeping macros simple.\n\nWherever possible, you should use a preprocessor geared to the language\nyou are writing in.  Modern versions of the GNU assembler have macro\nfacilities.  Most high level programming languages have their own\nconditional compilation and inclusion mechanism.  If all else fails,\ntry a true general text processor, such as GNU M4.\n\nC preprocessors vary in some details.  This manual discusses the GNU C\npreprocessor, which provides a small superset of the features of ISO\nStandard C.  In its default mode, the GNU C preprocessor does not do a\nfew things required by the standard.  These are features which are\nrarely, if ever, used, and may cause surprising changes to the meaning\nof a program which does not expect them.  To get strict ISO Standard C,\nyou should use the -std=c90, -std=c99, -std=c11 or -std=c17 options,\ndepending on which version of the standard you want.  To get all the\nmandatory diagnostics, you must also use -pedantic.\n\nThis manual describes the behavior of the ISO preprocessor.  To\nminimize gratuitous differences, where the ISO preprocessor's behavior\ndoes not conflict with traditional semantics, the traditional\npreprocessor should behave the same way.  The various differences that\ndo exist are detailed in the section Traditional Mode.\n\nFor clarity, unless noted otherwise, references to CPP in this manual\nrefer to GNU CPP."

Each set of rules is called a chain.  Each chain is an ordered\nlist of rules that can match Ethernet frames. If a rule matches an\nEthernet frame, then a processing specification tells what to do with\nthat matching frame. The processing specification is called a 'target'.\nHowever, if the frame does not match the current rule in the chain,\nthen the next rule in the chain is examined and so forth.  The user can\ncreate new (user-defined) chains that can be used as the 'target' of a\nrule. User-defined chains are very useful to get better performance\nover the linear traversal of the rules and are also essential for\nstructuring the filtering rules into well-organized and maintainable\nsets of rules.\n\nTARGETS\nA firewall rule specifies criteria for an Ethernet frame and a frame\nprocessing specification called a target.  When a frame matches a rule,\nthen the next action performed by the kernel is specified by the\ntarget.\tThe target can be one of these values: ACCEPT, DROP, CONTINUE,\nRETURN, an 'extension' (see below) or a jump to a user-defined chain.\n\nACCEPT means to let the frame through.  DROP means the frame has to be\ndropped.  CONTINUE means the next rule has to be checked. This can be\nhandy, f.e., to know how many frames pass a certain point in the chain,\nto log those frames or to apply multiple targets on a frame.  RETURN\nmeans stop traversing this chain and resume at the next rule in the\nprevious (calling) chain.  For the extension targets please refer to\nthe TARGET EXTENSIONS section of this man page.\n\nTABLES\nAs stated earlier, there are two ebtables tables in the Linux kernel.\nThe table names are filter and nat.  Of these two tables, the filter\ntable is the default table that the command operates on.  If you are\nworking with the filter table, then you can drop the '-t filter'\nargument to the ebtables command.  However, you will need to provide\nthe -t argument for nat table.  Moreover, the -t argument must be the\nfirst argument on the ebtables command line, if used.\n"

You can also use gcov along with the other\nprofiling tool, gprof, to assess which parts of your code use the\ngreatest amount of computing time.\n\nProfiling tools help you analyze your code's performance.  Using a\nprofiler such as gcov or gprof, you can find out some basic performance\nstatistics, such as:\n\n*   how often each line of code executes\n\n*   what lines of code are actually executed\n\n*   how much computing time each section of code uses\n\nOnce you know these things about how your code works when compiled, you\ncan look at each module to see which modules should be optimized.  gcov\nhelps you determine where to work on optimization.\n\nSoftware developers also use coverage testing in concert with\ntestsuites, to make sure software is actually good enough for a\nrelease.  Testsuites can verify that a program works as expected; a\ncoverage program tests to see how much of the program is exercised by\nthe testsuite.  Developers can then determine what kinds of test cases\nneed to be added to the testsuites to create both better testing and a\nbetter final product.\n\nYou should compile your code without optimization if you plan to use\ngcov because the optimization, by combining some lines of code into one\nfunction, may not give you as much information as you need to look for\n`hot spots' where the code is using a great deal of computer time.\nLikewise, because gcov accumulates statistics by line (at the lowest\nresolution), it works best with a programming style that places only\none statement on each line.  If you use complicated macros that expand\nto loops or to other control structures, the statistics are less\nhelpful---they only report on the line where the macro call appears.\nIf your complex macros behave like functions, you can replace them with\ninline functions to solve this problem.\n\ngcov creates a logfile called sourcefile.gcov which indicates how many\ntimes each line of a source file sourcefile.c has executed.  You can\nuse these logfiles along with gprof to aid in fine-tuning the\nperformance of your programs.  gprof gives timing information you can\nuse along with the information you get from gcov.\n\ngcov works only on code compiled with GCC.

Xcms then uses display gamma information stored in the\nXDCCC_LINEAR_RGB_CORRECTION property to convert color specifications\nbetween RGBi and RGB device (XcmsRGB, also referred to as device RGB).\n\nNote that Xcms allows clients to register function sets in addition to\nits built-in function set for CRT color monitors.  Additional function\nsets may store their device profile information in other properties in\nfunction set specific format.  This utility is unaware of these non-\nstandard properties.\n\nThe ASCII readable contents of filename (or the standard input if no\ninput file is given) are appropriately transformed for storage in\nproperties, provided the -query or -remove options are not specified."

It will automatically convert an old-style Master Boot\nRecord (MBR) partition table or BSD disklabel stored without an MBR\ncarrier partition to the newer Globally Unique Identifier (GUID)\nPartition Table (GPT) format, or will load a GUID partition table.\nOther members of this program family are gdisk (the most feature-rich\nprogram of the group, with a non-curses-based interactive user\ninterface) and sgdisk (which is driven via command-line options for use\nby experts or in scripts).  FixParts is a related program for fixing a\nlimited set of problems with MBR disks.\n\nFor information on MBR vs. GPT, as well as GPT terminology and\nstructure, see the extended GPT fdisk documentation at\nhttp://www.rodsbooks.com/gdisk/ or consult Wikipedia.\n\nThe cgdisk program employs a user interface similar to that of Linux's\ncfdisk, but cgdisk modifies GPT partitions. It also has the capability\nof transforming MBR partitions or BSD disklabels into GPT partitions.\nLike the original cfdisk program, cgdisk does not modify disk\nstructures until you explicitly write them to disk, so if you make a\nmistake, you can exit from the program with the Quit option to leave\nyour partitions unmodified.\n\nOrdinarily, cgdisk operates on disk device files, such as /dev/sda or\n/dev/hda under Linux, /dev/disk0 under Mac OS X, or /dev/ad0 or\n/dev/da0 under FreeBSD. The program can also operate on disk image\nfiles, which can be either copies of whole disks (made with dd, for\ninstance) or raw disk images used by emulators such as QEMU or VMWare.\nNote that only raw disk images are supported; cgdisk cannot work on\ncompressed or other advanced disk image formats.\n\nUpon start, cgdisk attempts to identify the partition type in use on\nthe disk. If it finds valid GPT data, cgdisk will use it. If cgdisk\nfinds a valid MBR or BSD disklabel but no GPT data, it will attempt to\nconvert the MBR or disklabel into GPT form. (BSD disklabels are likely\nto have unusable first and/or final partitions because they overlap\nwith the GPT data structures, though.) Upon exiting with the 'w'\noption, cgdisk replaces the MBR or disklabel with a GPT. This action is\npotentially dangerous! Your system may become unbootable, and partition\ntype codes may become corrupted if the disk uses unrecognized type\ncodes.  Boot problems are particularly likely if you're multi-booting\nwith any GPT-unaware OS. If you mistakenly launch cgdisk on an MBR\ndisk, you can safely exit the program without making any changes by\nusing the Quit option.\n\nWhen creating a fresh partition table, certain considerations may be in\norder:\n"

What this means is that\nless can automatically open up tar files, uncompress gzipped files, and\neven display something reasonable for graphics files.\n\nlesspipe will toss the contents/info on STDOUT and less will read them\nas they come across.  This means that you do not have to wait for the\ndecoding to finish before less shows you the file.  This also means\nthat you will get a 'byte N' instead of an N% as your file position.\nYou can seek to the end and back to get the N% but that means you have\nto wait for the pipe to finish.\n\nlessfile will toss the contents/info on a file which less will then\nread.  After you are done, lessfile will then delete the file.  This\nmeans that the process has to finish before you see it, but you get\nnice percentages (N%) up front."

You can also use gcov along with the other\nprofiling tool, gprof, to assess which parts of your code use the\ngreatest amount of computing time.\n\nProfiling tools help you analyze your code's performance.

Testsuites can verify that a program works as expected; a\ncoverage program tests to see how much of the program is exercised by\nthe testsuite.  Developers can then determine what kinds of test cases\nneed to be added to the testsuites to create both better testing and a\nbetter final product.\n\nYou should compile your code without optimization if you plan to use\ngcov because the optimization, by combining some lines of code into one\nfunction, may not give you as much information as you need to look for\n`hot spots' where the code is using a great deal of computer time.\nLikewise, because gcov accumulates statistics by line (at the lowest\nresolution), it works best with a programming style that places only\none statement on each line.  If you use complicated macros that expand\nto loops or to other control structures, the statistics are less\nhelpful---they only report on the line where the macro call appears.\nIf your complex macros behave like functions, you can replace them with\ninline functions to solve this problem.\n\ngcov creates a logfile called sourcefile.gcov which indicates how many\ntimes each line of a source file sourcefile.c has executed.  You can\nuse these logfiles along with gprof to aid in fine-tuning the\nperformance of your programs.  gprof gives timing information you can\nuse along with the information you get from gcov.\n\ngcov works only on code compiled with GCC.

User-defined chains are very useful to get better performance\nover the linear traversal of the rules and are also essential for\nstructuring the filtering rules into well-organized and maintainable\nsets of rules.\n\nTARGETS\nA firewall rule specifies criteria for an Ethernet frame and a frame\nprocessing specification called a target.  When a frame matches a rule,\nthen the next action performed by the kernel is specified by the\ntarget.\tThe target can be one of these values: ACCEPT, DROP, CONTINUE,\nRETURN, an 'extension' (see below) or a jump to a user-defined chain.\n\nACCEPT means to let the frame through.  DROP means the frame has to be\ndropped.  CONTINUE means the next rule has to be checked. This can be\nhandy, f.e., to know how many frames pass a certain point in the chain,\nto log those frames or to apply multiple targets on a frame.  RETURN\nmeans stop traversing this chain and resume at the next rule in the\nprevious (calling) chain.  For the extension targets please refer to\nthe TARGET EXTENSIONS section of this man page.\n\nTABLES\nAs stated earlier, there are two ebtables tables in the Linux kernel.\nThe table names are filter and nat.  Of these two tables, the filter\ntable is the default table that the command operates on.  If you are\nworking with the filter table, then you can drop the '-t filter'\nargument to the ebtables command.  However, you will need to provide\nthe -t argument for nat table.  Moreover, the -t argument must be the\nfirst argument on the ebtables command line, if used.\n"

    "description": "upgrade a source code package from an upstream revision\nuupdate modifies an existing Debian source code archive to reflect an\nupstream update supplied as a patch or from a wholly new source code\narchive.  The utility needs to be invoked from the top directory of the\nold source code directory, and if a relative name is given for the new\narchive or patch file, it will be looked for first relative to the\nexecution directory and then relative to the parent of the source tree.\n(For example, if the changelog file is\n/usr/local/src/foo/foo-1.1/debian/changelog, then the archive or patch\nfile will be looked for relative to /usr/local/src/foo.)  Note that the\npatch file or archive cannot be within the source tree itself.  The\nfull details of what the code does are given below.\n\nCurrently supported source code file types are .tar.gz, .tar.bz2,\n.tar.Z, .tgz, .tar, .tar.lzma, .tar.xz, .7z and .zip archives.  Also\nsupported are already unpacked source code archives; simply give the\npath of the source code directory.  Supported patch file types are\ngzip-compressed, bzip2-compressed, lzma-compressed, xz-compressed and\nuncompressed patch files.  The file types are identified by the file\nnames, so they must use the standard suffixes.\n\nUsually uupdate will be able to deduce the version number from the\nsource archive name (as long as it only contains digits and periods).\nIf that fails, you need to specify the version number explicitly\n(without the Debian release number which will always be initially \u201c1\u201d,\nor \u201c0ubuntu1\u201d on Ubuntu-detected systems).  This can be done with an\ninitial --upstream-version or -v option, or in the case of an archive,\nwith a version number after the filename.  (The reason for the latter\nis so that uupdate can be called directly from uscan.)\n\nSince uupdate uses debuild to clean the current archive before trying\nto apply a patch file, it accepts a --rootcmd or -r option allowing the\nuser to specify a gain-root command to be used.\tThe default is to use\nfakeroot.\n\nIf an archive is being built, the pristine upstream source should be\nused to create the .orig.tar.gz file wherever possible.\tThis means\nthat MD5 sums or other similar methods can be used to easily compare\nthe upstream source to Debian's copy of the upstream version.  This is\nthe default behaviour, and can be switched off using the --no-pristine\noption below."

There is\nactually only one main program; the specific layout algorithms are\nimplemented as plugins. Thus, they largely share all of the same\ncommand-line options.\n\ndot draws directed graphs.  It works well on directed acyclic graphs\nand other graphs that can be drawn as hierarchies or have a natural\n``flow.''\n\nneato draws undirected graphs using a ``spring'' model and reducing the\nrelated energy (see Kamada and Kawai, Information Processing Letters\n31:1, April 1989).\n\ntwopi draws graphs using a radial layout (see G. Wills, Symposium on\nGraph Drawing GD'97, September, 1997).  Basically, one node is chosen\nas the center and put at the origin.  The remaining nodes are placed on\na sequence of concentric circles centered about the origin, each a\nfixed radial distance from the previous circle.\tAll nodes distance 1\nfrom the center are placed on the first circle; all nodes distance 1\nfrom a node on the first circle are placed on the second circle; and so\nforth.\n\ncirco draws graphs using a circular layout (see Six and Tollis, GD '99\nand ALENEX '99, and Kaufmann and Wiese, GD '02.)  The tool identifies\nbiconnected components and draws the nodes of the component on a\ncircle. The block\u2010cutpoint tree is then laid out using a recursive\nradial algorithm. Edge crossings within a circle are minimized by\nplacing as many edges on the circle's perimeter as possible.  In\nparticular, if the component is outerplanar, the component will have a\nplanar layout.  If a node belongs to multiple non\u2010trivial biconnected\ncomponents, the layout puts the node in one of them. By default, this\nis the first non\u2010trivial component found in the search from the root\ncomponent.\n\nfdp draws undirected graphs using a ``spring'' model. It relies on a\nforce\u2010directed approach in the spirit of Fruchterman and Reingold (cf.\nSoftware\u2010Practice & Experience 21(11), 1991, pp. 1129\u20101164).\n\nsfdp also draws undirected graphs using the ``spring'' model described\nabove, but it uses a multi-scale approach to produce layouts of large\ngraphs in a reasonably short time.\n\npatchwork draws the graph as a squarified treemap (see M. Bruls et al.,\n``Squarified treemaps'', Proc. Joint Eurographics and IEEE TCVG Symp.\non Visualization, 2000, pp. 33-42). The clusters of the graph are used\nto specify the tree.\n\nosage draws the graph using its cluster structure. For a given cluster,\neach of its subclusters is laid out internally.\tThen the subclusters,\nplus any remaining nodes, are repositioned based on the cluster's pack\nand packmode attributes."

ALSABAT can be used to test audio quality,\nstress test features and test audio before and after PM state changes.\n\nALSABAT's design is relatively simple. ALSABAT plays an audio stream\nand captures the same stream in either a digital or analog loop back.\nIt then compares the captured stream using a FFT to the original to\ndetermine if the test case passes or fails.\n\nALSABAT can either run wholly on the target machine being tested\n(standalone mode) or can run as a client/server mode where by alsabat\nclient runs on the target and runs as a server on a separate tester\nmachine. The client/server mode still requires some manual interaction\nfor synchronization, but this is actively being developed for future\nreleases.\n\nThe hardware testing configuration may require the use of an analog\ncable connecting target to tester machines or a cable to create an\nanalog loopback if no loopback mode is not available on the sound\nhardware that is being tested.  An analog loopback cable can be used to\nconnect the \"line in\" to \"line out\" jacks to create a loopback. If only\nheadphone and mic jacks (or combo jack) are available then the\nfollowing simple circuit can be used to create an analog loopback :-\n\nhttps://source.android.com/devices/audio/loopback.html\n\nIf tinyalsa is installed in system, user can choose tinyalsa as backend\nlib of alsabat, with configure option \"--enable-alsabat-backend-tiny\"."

    "description": "Spawn a command or OS in a light-weight container\nsystemd-nspawn may be used to run a command or OS in a light-weight\nnamespace container. In many ways it is similar to chroot(1), but more\npowerful since it fully virtualizes the file system hierarchy, as well\nas the process tree, the various IPC subsystems and the host and domain\nname.\n\nsystemd-nspawn may be invoked on any directory tree containing an\noperating system tree, using the --directory= command line option. By\nusing the --machine= option an OS tree is automatically searched for in\na couple of locations, most importantly in /var/lib/machines, the\nsuggested directory to place OS container images installed on the\nsystem.\n\nIn contrast to chroot(1) systemd-nspawn may be used to boot full\nLinux-based operating systems in a container.\n\nsystemd-nspawn limits access to various kernel interfaces in the\ncontainer to read-only, such as /sys, /proc/sys or /sys/fs/selinux. The\nhost's network interfaces and the system clock may not be changed from\nwithin the container. Device nodes may not be created. The host system\ncannot be rebooted and kernel modules may not be loaded from within the\ncontainer.\n\nUse a tool like dnf(8), debootstrap(8), or pacman(8) to set up an OS\ndirectory tree suitable as file system hierarchy for systemd-nspawn\ncontainers. See the Examples section below for details on suitable\ninvocation of these commands.\n\nAs a safety check systemd-nspawn will verify the existence of\n/usr/lib/os-release or /etc/os-release in the container tree before\nstarting the container (see os-release(5)). It might be necessary to\nadd this file to the container tree manually if the OS of the container\nis too old to contain this file out-of-the-box.\n\nsystemd-nspawn may be invoked directly from the interactive command\nline or run as system service in the background. In this mode each\ncontainer instance runs as its own service instance; a default template\nunit file systemd-nspawn@.service is provided to make this easy, taking\nthe container name as instance identifier. Note that different default\noptions apply when systemd-nspawn is invoked by the template unit file\nthan interactively on the command line. Most importantly the template\nunit file makes use of the --boot which is not the default in case\nsystemd-nspawn is invoked from the interactive command line. Further\ndifferences with the defaults are documented along with the various\nsupported options below.\n\nThe machinectl(1) tool may be used to execute a number of operations on\ncontainers. In particular it provides easy-to-use commands to run\ncontainers as system services using the systemd-nspawn@.service\ntemplate unit file.\n\nAlong with each container a settings file with the .nspawn suffix may\nexist, containing additional settings to apply when running the\ncontainer. See systemd.nspawn(5) for details. Settings files override\nthe default options used by the systemd-nspawn@.service template unit\nfile, making it usually unnecessary to alter this template file\ndirectly.\n\nNote that systemd-nspawn will mount file systems private to the\ncontainer to /dev, /run and similar. These will not be visible outside\nof the container, and their contents will be lost when the container\nexits.\n\nNote that running two systemd-nspawn containers from the same directory\ntree will not make processes in them see each other. The PID namespace\nseparation of the two containers is complete and the containers will\nshare very few runtime objects except for the underlying file system.\nUse machinectl(1)'s login or shell commands to request an additional\nlogin session in a running container.\n\nsystemd-nspawn implements the Container Interface[1] specification.\n\nWhile running, containers invoked with systemd-nspawn are registered\nwith the systemd-machined(8) service that keeps track of running\ncontainers, and provides programming interfaces to interact with them."

The individual check value for each chunk is also\ncalculated in parallel.\tThe compressed data is written in order to the\noutput, and a combined check value is calculated from the individual\ncheck values.\n\nThe compressed data format generated is in the gzip, zlib, or single-\nentry zip format using the deflate compression method.  The compression\nproduces partial raw deflate streams which are concatenated by a single\nwrite thread and wrapped with the appropriate header and trailer, where\nthe trailer contains the combined check value.\n\nEach partial raw deflate stream is terminated by an empty stored block\n(using the Z_SYNC_FLUSH option of zlib), in order to end that partial\nbit stream at a byte boundary.  That allows the partial streams to be\nconcatenated simply as sequences of bytes.  This adds a very small four\nto five byte overhead to the output for each input chunk.\n\nThe default input block size is 128K, but can be changed with the -b\noption.\tThe number of compress threads is set by default to the number\nof online processors, which can be changed using the -p option.\nSpecifying -p 1 avoids the use of threads entirely.\n\nThe input blocks, while compressed independently, have the last 32K of\nthe previous block loaded as a preset dictionary to preserve the\ncompression effectiveness of deflating in a single thread.  This can be\nturned off using the -i or --independent option, so that the blocks can\nbe decompressed independently for partial error recovery or for random\naccess. This also inserts an extra empty block to flag independent\nblocks by prefacing each with the nine-byte sequence (in hex): 00 00 FF\nFF 00 00 00 FF FF.\n\nDecompression can't be parallelized, at least not without specially\nprepared deflate streams for that purpose.  As a result, pigz uses a\nsingle thread (the main thread) for decompression, but will create\nthree other threads for reading, writing, and check calculation, which\ncan speed up decompression under some circumstances.  Parallel\ndecompression can be turned off by specifying one process ( -dp 1 or\n-tp 1 ).\n\nAll options on the command line are processed before any names are\nprocessed.  If no names are provided on the command line, or if \"-\" is\ngiven as a name (but not after \"--\"), then the input is taken from\nstdin.\n\nCompressed files can be restored to their original form using pigz -d\nor unpigz."

When an ACPI event is\nreceived from one of these sources, acpid will examine a list of rules,\nand execute the rules that match the event. acpid will ignore all\nincoming ACPI events if a lock file exists (/var/lock/acpid by\ndefault).\n\nRules are defined by simple configuration files.  acpid will look in a\nconfiguration directory (/etc/acpi/events by default), and parse all\nregular files with names that consist entirely of upper and lower case\nletters, digits, underscores, and hyphens (similar to run-parts(8))\nthat do not begin with a period ('.') or end with a tilde (~).  Each\nfile must define two things: an event and an action.  Any blank lines,\nor lines where the first character is a hash ('#') are ignored.\nExtraneous lines are flagged as warnings, but are not fatal.  Each line\nhas three tokens: the key, a literal equal sign, and the value.\tThe\nkey can be up to 63 characters, and is case-insensitive (but whitespace\nmatters).  The value can be up to 511 characters, and is case and\nwhitespace sensitive.\n\nThe event value is a regular expression (see regcomp(3)), against which\nevents are matched.\n\nThe action value is a commandline, which will be invoked via /bin/sh\nwhenever an event matching the rule in question occurs.\tThe\ncommandline may include shell-special characters, and they will be\npreserved.  The only special characters in an action value are \"%\"\nescaped.  The string \"%e\" will be replaced by the literal text of the\nevent for which the action was invoked.\tThis string may contain\nspaces, so the commandline must take care to quote the \"%e\" if it wants\na single token.\tThe string \"%%\" will be replaced by a literal \"%\".\nAll other \"%\" escapes are reserved, and will cause a rule to not load.\n\nThis feature allows multiple rules to be defined for the same event\n(though no ordering is guaranteed), as well as one rule to be defined\nfor multiple events.  To force acpid to reload the rule configuration,\nsend it a SIGHUP.\n\nThe pseudo-action <drop> causes the event to be dropped completely and\nno further processing undertaken; clients connecting via the UNIX\ndomain socket (see below) will not be notified of the event. This may\nbe useful on some machines, such as certain laptops which generate\nspurious battery events at frequent intervals. The name of this pseudo-\naction may be redefined with a commandline option.\n\nIn addition to rule files, acpid also accepts connections on a UNIX\ndomain socket (/var/run/acpid.socket by default).  Any application may\nconnect to this socket.\tOnce connected, acpid will send the text of\nall ACPI events to the client.  The client has the responsibility of\nfiltering for messages about which it cares.  acpid will not close the\nclient socket except in the case of a SIGHUP or acpid exiting.\n\nFor faster startup, this socket can be passed in as stdin so that acpid\nneed not create the socket.  In addition, if a socket is passed in as\nstdin, acpid will not daemonize.

This is useful when the compressed file name was truncated or\nwhen the timestamp was not preserved after a file transfer.\n\nCompressed files can be restored to their original form using gzip -d\nor gunzip or zcat.  If the original name saved in the compressed file\nis not suitable for its file system, a new name is constructed from the\noriginal one to make it legal.\n\ngunzip takes a list of files on its command line and replaces each file\nwhose name ends with .gz, -gz, .z, -z, or _z (ignoring case) and which\nbegins with the correct magic number with an uncompressed file without\nthe original extension.\tgunzip also recognizes the special extensions\n.tgz and .taz as shorthands for .tar.gz and .tar.Z respectively.  When\ncompressing, gzip uses the .tgz extension if necessary instead of\ntruncating a file with a .tar extension.\n\ngunzip can currently decompress files created by gzip, zip, compress,\ncompress -H or pack.  The detection of the input format is automatic.\nWhen using the first two formats, gunzip checks a 32 bit CRC. For pack\nand gunzip checks the uncompressed length. The standard compress format\nwas not designed to allow consistency checks. However gunzip is\nsometimes able to detect a bad .Z file. If you get an error when\nuncompressing a .Z file, do not assume that the .Z file is correct\nsimply because the standard uncompress does not complain. This\ngenerally means that the standard uncompress does not check its input,\nand happily generates garbage output.  The SCO compress -H format (lzh\ncompression method) does not include a CRC but also allows some\nconsistency checks.\n\nFiles created by zip can be uncompressed by gzip only if they have a\nsingle member compressed with the 'deflation' method. This feature is\nonly intended to help conversion of tar.zip files to the tar.gz format.\nTo extract a zip file with a single member, use a command like gunzip\n<foo.zip or gunzip -S .zip foo.zip.  To extract zip files with several\nmembers, use unzip instead of gunzip.\n\nzcat is identical to gunzip -c.\t(On some systems, zcat may be\ninstalled as gzcat to preserve the original link to compress.)  zcat\nuncompresses either a list of files on the command line or its standard\ninput and writes the uncompressed data on standard output.  zcat will\nuncompress files that have the correct magic number whether they have a\n.gz suffix or not.\n\nGzip uses the Lempel-Ziv algorithm used in zip and PKZIP.  The amount\nof compression obtained depends on the size of the input and the\ndistribution of common substrings.  Typically, text such as source code\nor English is reduced by 60-70%.  Compression is generally much better\nthan that achieved by LZW (as used in compress), Huffman coding (as\nused in pack), or adaptive Huffman coding (compact).\n\nCompression is always performed, even if the compressed file is\nslightly larger than the original. The worst case expansion is a few\nbytes for the gzip file header, plus 5 bytes every 32K block, or an\nexpansion ratio of 0.015% for large files. Note that the actual number\nof used disk blocks almost never increases.  gzip preserves the mode,\nownership and timestamps of files when compressing or decompressing."

Testsuites can verify that a program works as expected; a\ncoverage program tests to see how much of the program is exercised by\nthe testsuite.  Developers can then determine what kinds of test cases\nneed to be added to the testsuites to create both better testing and a\nbetter final product.\n\nYou should compile your code without optimization if you plan to use\ngcov because the optimization, by combining some lines of code into one\nfunction, may not give you as much information as you need to look for\n`hot spots' where the code is using a great deal of computer time.\nLikewise, because gcov accumulates statistics by line (at the lowest\nresolution), it works best with a programming style that places only\none statement on each line.  If you use complicated macros that expand\nto loops or to other control structures, the statistics are less\nhelpful---they only report on the line where the macro call appears.\nIf your complex macros behave like functions, you can replace them with\ninline functions to solve this problem.\n\ngcov creates a logfile called sourcefile.gcov which indicates how many\ntimes each line of a source file sourcefile.c has executed.  You can\nuse these logfiles along with gprof to aid in fine-tuning the\nperformance of your programs.  gprof gives timing information you can\nuse along with the information you get from gcov.\n\ngcov works only on code compiled with GCC.

It is analogous to a combination of the Unix commands tar(1) and\ncompress(1) and is compatible with PKZIP (Phil Katz's ZIP for MSDOS\nsystems).\n\nA companion program (unzip(1)) unpacks zip archives.  The zip and\nunzip(1) programs can work with archives produced by PKZIP (supporting\nmost PKZIP features up to PKZIP version 4.6), and PKZIP and PKUNZIP can\nwork with archives produced by zip (with some exceptions, notably\nstreamed archives, but recent changes in the zip file standard may\nfacilitate better compatibility).  zip version 3.0 is compatible with\nPKZIP 2.04 and also supports the Zip64 extensions of PKZIP 4.5 which\nallow archives as well as files to exceed the previous 2 GB limit (4 GB\nin some cases).\tzip also now supports bzip2 compression if the bzip2\nlibrary is included when zip is compiled.  Note that PKUNZIP 1.10\ncannot extract files produced by PKZIP 2.04 or zip 3.0. You must use\nPKUNZIP 2.04g or unzip 5.0p1 (or later versions) to extract them.\n\nSee the EXAMPLES section at the bottom of this page for examples of\nsome typical uses of zip.\n\nLarge Archives and Zip64.  zip automatically uses the Zip64 extensions\nwhen files larger than 4 GB are added to an archive, an archive\ncontaining Zip64 entries is updated (if the resulting archive still\nneeds Zip64), the size of the archive will exceed 4 GB, or when the\nnumber of entries in the archive will exceed about 64K.\tZip64 is also\nused for archives streamed from standard input as the size of such\narchives are not known in advance, but the option -fz- can be used to\nforce zip to create PKZIP 2 compatible archives (as long as Zip64\nextensions are not needed).  You must use a PKZIP 4.5 compatible unzip,\nsuch as unzip 6.0 or later, to extract files using the Zip64\nextensions.\n\nIn addition, streamed archives, entries encrypted with standard\nencryption, or split archives created with the pause option may not be\ncompatible with PKZIP as data descriptors are used and PKZIP at the\ntime of this writing does not support data descriptors (but recent\nchanges in the PKWare published zip standard now include some support\nfor the data descriptor format zip uses).\n\nMac OS X.  Though previous Mac versions had their own zip port, zip\nsupports Mac OS X as part of the Unix port and most Unix features\napply.  References to \"MacOS\" below generally refer to MacOS versions\nolder than OS X.  Support for some Mac OS features in the Unix Mac OS X\nport, such as resource forks, is expected in the next zip release.\n\nFor a brief help on zip and unzip, run each without specifying any\nparameters on the command line."

CHS has never been important for Linux, and\nthis addressing concept does not make any sense for new devices.\n\nsfdisk (since version 2.26) aligns the start and end of partitions to\nblock-device I/O limits when relative sizes are specified, when the\ndefault values are used or when multiplicative suffixes (e.g. MiB) are\nused for sizes.\tIt is possible that partition size will be optimized\n(reduced or enlarged) due to alignment if the start offset is specified\nexactly in sectors and partition size relative or by multiplicative\nsuffixes.\n\nThe recommended way is not to specify start offsets at all and specify\npartition size in MiB, GiB (or so).  In this case sfdisk align all\npartitions to block-device I/O limits (or when I/O limits are too small\nthen to megabyte boundary to keep disk layout portable).  If this\ndefault behaviour is unwanted (usually for very small partitions) then\nspecify offsets and sizes in sectors.  In this case sfdisk entirely\nfollows specified numbers without any optimization.\n\nsfdisk does not create the standard system partitions for SGI and SUN\ndisk labels like fdisk(8) does.\tIt is necessary to explicitly create\nall partitions including whole-disk system partitions.\n\nsfdisk uses BLKRRPART (reread partition table) ioctl to make sure that\nthe device is not used by system or another tools (see also --no-\nreread).  It's possible that this feature or another sfdisk activity\nraces with udevd.  The recommended way how to avoid possible collisions\nis to use exclusive flock for the whole-disk device to serialize device\naccess.\tThe exclusive lock will cause udevd to skip the event handling\non the device.

If it exists, the limit is often\n15 characters (typical of formats related to a.out) or 16 characters\n(typical of formats related to coff).\n\nar is considered a binary utility because archives of this sort are\nmost often used as libraries holding commonly needed subroutines.\n\nar creates an index to the symbols defined in relocatable object\nmodules in the archive when you specify the modifier s.\tOnce created,\nthis index is updated in the archive whenever ar makes a change to its\ncontents (save for the q update operation).  An archive with such an\nindex speeds up linking to the library, and allows routines in the\nlibrary to call each other without regard to their placement in the\narchive.\n\nYou may use nm -s or nm --print-armap to list this index table.\tIf an\narchive lacks the table, another form of ar called ranlib can be used\nto add just the table.\n\nGNU ar can optionally create a thin archive, which contains a symbol\nindex and references to the original copies of the member files of the\narchive.  This is useful for building libraries for use within a local\nbuild tree, where the relocatable objects are expected to remain\navailable, and copying the contents of each object would only waste\ntime and space.\n\nAn archive can either be thin or it can be normal.  It cannot be both\nat the same time.  Once an archive is created its format cannot be\nchanged without first deleting it and then creating a new archive in\nits place.\n\nThin archives are also flattened, so that adding one thin archive to\nanother thin archive does not nest it, as would happen with a normal\narchive.  Instead the elements of the first archive are added\nindividually to the second archive.\n\nThe paths to the elements of the archive are stored relative to the\narchive itself.\n\nGNU ar is designed to be compatible with two different facilities.  You\ncan control its activity using command-line options, like the different\nvarieties of ar on Unix systems; or, if you specify the single command-\nline option -M, you can control it with a script supplied via standard\ninput, like the MRI \"librarian\" program."

Doing so, the file system is restored\nto a consistent state, however updates to user data may still be lost.\n\nUpdating the file system generally requires updating several records\nwhich should all be made for the file system to be kept consistent. For\ninstance, creating a new file requires reserving an inode number (set a\nbit in a bit map), creating a file record (store the file name and file\nattributes), and registering the file in a directory (locate the file\nfrom some path). When an unfortunate event occurs, and one of these\nupdates could be done but not all of them, the file system is left\ninconsistent.\n\nA group of updates which have all to be done to preserve consistency is\ncalled a transaction, and the end of updates within a transaction is\ncalled the commitment of the transaction.\n\nTo protect from unfortunate events, Windows first logs in a special\nfile all the metadata update requests without applying any, until the\ncommitment is known. If the event occurs before the commitment, no\nupdate has been made and the file system is consistent. If the event\noccurs after the update, the log file can be analyzed later and the\ntransactions which were committed can be executed again, thus restoring\nthe integrity of the file system.\n\nntfsrecover similarly examines the log file and applies the updates\nwithin committed transactions which could not be done by Windows.\n\nCurrently, ntfs-3g does not log updates, so ntfsrecover cannot be used\nto restore consistency after an unfortunate event occurred while the\nfile system was updated by Linux."
