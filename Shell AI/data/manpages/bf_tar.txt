NAME
       bf_tar - shell script to write a tar file of a bogofilter directory to
       stdout

SYNOPSIS
       bf_tar [-r] [-R] bogofilter_directory

DESCRIPTION
       bf_tar bundles a bogofilter working directory in tar format and copies
       it to standard output (your console, or where you redirect it, see
       EXAMPLES below).

OPTIONS
       The -r option causes bf_tar to remove inactive log files after the
       archive has been written successfully. The default is to leave log
       files.

       The -R option causes bf_tar to remove inactive log files before the
       archive is written. This may reduce chances that the resulting archive
       is recoverable should it become damaged. The archive may be smaller
       though. The default is to leave log files.

EXIT STATUS
       The script exits with status code 0 if everything went well, and
       nonzero if it encountered trouble.

EXAMPLES
       •   bf_tar ~/.bogofilter > outfile.tar

	   Writes a standard .tar file containing the essential files from
	   ~/.bogofilter to outfile.tar.

       •   bf_tar ~/.bogofilter | gzip -9 -c > outfile.tar.gz

	   Writes a gzipped .tar.gz file containing the essential files from
	   ~/.bogofilter to outfile.tar.gz.

       •   bf_tar `pwd`/mydirectory > outfile.tar

	   Prepend $(pwd)/ or `pwd`/ if you want to specify an absolute path
	   instead of a relative path.

NOTES
       This script is meant for use with Berkeley DB based bogofilter
       versions.

       This script requires a SUSv2 compliant pax utility.

       This script expects a SUSv2 compliant shell. Solaris systems should
       have the SUNWxcu4 package installed (when bogofilter is configured) so
       that /usr/xpg4/bin/sh can be used.
