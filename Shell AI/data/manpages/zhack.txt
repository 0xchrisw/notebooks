NAME
       zhack - libzpool debugging tool

DESCRIPTION
       This utility pokes configuration changes directly into a ZFS pool,
       which is dangerous and can cause data corruption.

SYNOPSIS
       zhack [-c cachefile] [-d dir] <subcommand> [arguments]

OPTIONS
       -c cachefile

	      Read the pool configuration from the cachefile, which is
	      /etc/zfs/zpool.cache by default.

       -d dir

	      Search for pool members in the dir path. Can be specified more
	      than once.

SUBCOMMANDS
       feature stat pool

	      List feature flags.

       feature enable [-d description] [-r] pool guid

	      Add a new feature to pool that is uniquely identified by guid,
	      which is specified in the same form as a zfs(8) user property.

	      The description is a short human readable explanation of the new
	      feature.

	      The -r switch indicates that pool can be safely opened in read-
	      only mode by a system that does not have the guid feature.

       feature ref [-d|-m] pool guid

	      Increment the reference count of the guid feature in pool.

	      The -d switch decrements the reference count of the guid feature
	      in pool.

	      The -m switch indicates that the guid feature is now required to
	      read the pool MOS.

EXAMPLES
       # zhack feature stat tank

       for_read_obj:
	    org.illumos:lz4_compress = 0
       for_write_obj:
	    com.delphix:async_destroy = 0
	    com.delphix:empty_bpobj = 0
       descriptions_obj:
	    com.delphix:async_destroy = Destroy filesystems asynchronously.
	    com.delphix:empty_bpobj = Snapshots use less space.
	    org.illumos:lz4_compress = LZ4 compression algorithm support.

       # zhack feature enable -d 'Predict future disk failures.' \
	   tank com.example:clairvoyance

       # zhack feature ref tank com.example:clairvoyance
