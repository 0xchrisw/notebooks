DESCRIPTION
       Bogoutil is part of the bogofilter Bayesian spam filter package.

       It is used to dump and load bogofilter's Berkeley DB databases to and
       from text files, perform database maintenance functions, and to display
       the values for specific words.

OPTIONS
       The -d file option tells bogoutil to print the contents of the database
       file to stdout.

       The -H file option tells bogoutil to print a histogram of the database
       file to stdout. The output is similar to bogofilter -vv. Finally,
       hapaxes (tokens which were only seen once) and pure tokens (tokens
       which were encountered only in ham or only in spam) are counted.

       The -l file option tells bogoutil to load the data from stdin into the
       database file. If the database file exists, stdin data is merged into
       the database file, with counts added up.

       The -m option tells bogoutil to perform maintenance functions on the
       specified database, i.e. discard tokens that are older than desired,
       have counts that are too small, or sizes (lengths) that are too long or
       too short.

       The -w file option tells bogoutil to display token information from the
       database file. The option takes an argument, which is either the name
       of the wordlist (usually wordlist.db) or the name of the directory
       containing it. Tokens can be listed on the command line or piped to
       bogoutil. When there are extra arguments on the command line, bogoutil
       will use them as the tokens to lookup. If there are no extra arguments,
       bogoutil will read tokens from stdin.

       The -p file option tells bogoutil to display the database information
       for one or more tokens. The display includes a probability column with
       the token's spam score (computed using bogofilter's default values).
       Option -p takes the same arguments as option -w .

       The -r file option tells bogoutil to recalculate the ROBX value and
       print it as a six-digit fraction.

       The -R file option does the same as -r, but saves the result in the
       training database without printing it.

       The -I file option tells bogoutil to read its input from file rather
       than stdin.

       The -O file option tells bogoutil to write its output to file rather
       than stdout.

       The -v option produces verbose output on stderr. This option is
       primarily useful for debugging.

       The -C inhibits reading configuration files and lets bogoutil go with
       the defaults.

       The --config-file file option tells bogoutil to read file instead of
       the standard configuration file.

       The -D redirects debug output to stdout (it usually goes to stderr).

       The -x flags option sets debugging flags.

       Option -n stands for "replace non-ascii characters". It will replace
       characters with the high bit (0x80) by question marks. This can be
       useful if a word list has lots of unreadable tokens, for example from
       Asian spam. The "bad" characters will be converted to question marks
       and matching tokens will be combined when used with -m or -l, but not
       with -d.

       Option -a age indicates an acceptable token age, with older ones being
       discarded. The age can be a date (in form YYYYMMMDD) or a day count,
       i.e. discard tokens older than age days.

       Option -c value indicates that tokens with counts less than or equal to
       value are to be discarded.

       Option -s min,max is used to discard tokens based on their size, i.e.
       length. All tokens shorter than min or longer than max will be
       discarded.

       Option -y date is specifies the date to give to tokens that don't have
       dates. The format is YYYYMMDD.

       The -h option prints the help message and exits.

       The -V option prints the version number and exits.

ENVIRONMENT MAINTENANCE
       The --db-checkpoint dir option causes bogoutil to flush the buffer
       caches and checkpoint the database environment.

       The --db-list-logfiles dir option causes bogoutil to list the log files
       in the environment. Zero or more keywords can be added or combined
       (separated by whitespace) to modify the behavior of this mode. The
       default behavior is to list only inactive log files with relative
       paths. You can add all to list all log files (inactive and active). You
       can add absolute to switch the listing to absolute paths.

       The --db-prune dir option causes bogoutil to checkpoint the database
       environment and remove inactive log files.

       The --db-recover dir option runs a regular database recovery in the
       specified database directory. If that fails, it will retry with a
       (usually slower) catastrophic database recovery. If that fails, too,
       your database cannot be repaired and must be rebuilt from scratch. This
       is only supported when compiled with Berkeley DB support with
       transactions enabled. Trying recovery with QDBM or SQLite3 support will
       result in an error.

       The --db-recover-harder dir option runs a catastrophic data base
       recovery in the specified database directory. If that fails, your
       database cannot be repaired and must be rebuilt from scratch. This is
       only supported when compiled with Berkeley DB support with transactions
       enabled. Trying recovery with QDBM or SQLite3 support will result in an
       error.

       The --db-remove-environment directory option has no short option
       equivalent. It runs recovery in the given directory and then removes
       the database environment. Use this before upgrading to a new Berkeley
       DB version if the new version to be installed requires a log file
       format update.

       The --db-print-leafpage-count file option prints the number of leaf
       pages in the database file file as a decimal number, or UNKNOWN if the
       database does not support querying this figure.

       The --db-print-pagesize file option prints the size of a database page
       in file as a decimal number, or UNKNOWN for databases with variable
       page size or databases that do not allow a query of the database page
       size.

       The --db-verify file option requests that bogofilter verifies the
       database file. It prints only errors, unless in verbose mode.

DATA FORMAT
       Bogoutil reads and writes text files where each nonblank line consists
       of a word, any amount of horizontal whitespace, a numeric word count,
       more whitespace, and (optionally) a date in form YYYYMMDD. Blank lines
       are skipped.

RETURN VALUES
       0 for successful operation. 1 for most errors. 3 for I/O or other
       errors. Error 3 usually means that something is seriously wrong with
       the database files.
