DB5.3_ARCHIVE(1)	    General Commands Manual	      DB5.3_ARCHIVE(1)

NAME
       db5.3_archive - Find unused log files for archiving purposes

SYNOPSIS
       db5.3_archive [-adlsVv] [-h home] [-P password]

DESCRIPTION
       The db5.3_archive utility writes the pathnames of log files that are no
       longer in use (for example, no longer involved in active transactions),
       to the standard output, one pathname per line.  These log files should
       be written to backup media to provide for recovery in the case of
       catastrophic failure (which also requires a snapshot of the database
       files), but they may then be deleted from the system to reclaim disk
       space.

OPTIONS
       -a     Write all pathnames as absolute pathnames, instead of relative
	      to the database home directories.

       -d     Remove log files that are no longer needed; no filenames are
	      written.	Automatic log file removal is likely to make
	      catastrophic recovery impossible.

       -h     Specify a home directory for the database environment; by
	      default, the current working directory is used.

       -l     Write out the pathnames of all the database log files, whether
	      or not they are involved in active transactions.

       -P     Specify an environment password.	Although Berkeley DB utilities
	      overwrite password strings as soon as possible, be aware there
	      may be a window of vulnerability on systems where unprivileged
	      users can see command-line arguments or where utilities are not
	      able to overwrite the memory containing the command-line
	      arguments.

       -s     Write the pathnames of all the database files that need to be
	      archived in order to recover the database from catastrophic
	      failure.	If any of the database files have not been accessed
	      during the lifetime of the current log files, db5.3_archive will
	      not include them in this output.

	      It is possible that some of the files to which the log refers
	      have since been deleted from the system.	In this case,
	      db5.3_archive will ignore them.  When db5.3_recover is run, any
	      files to which the log refers that are not present during
	      recovery are assumed to have been deleted and will not be
	      recovered.

       -V     Write the library version number to the standard output, and
	      exit.

       -v     Run in verbose mode, listing the checkpoints in the log files as
	      they are reviewed.

       Log cursor handles (returned by the DB_ENV->log_cursor method) may have
       open file descriptors for log files in the database environment.  Also,
       the Berkeley DB interfaces to the database environment logging
       subsystem (for example, DB_ENV->log_put and DB_TXN->abort) may allocate
       log cursors and have open file descriptors for log files as well.  On
       operating systems where filesystem related system calls (for example,
       rename and unlink on Windows/NT) can fail if a process has an open file
       descriptor for the affected file, attempting to move or remove the log
       files listed by db5.3_archive may fail.	All Berkeley DB internal use
       of log cursors operates on active log files only and furthermore, is
       short-lived in nature.  So, an application seeing such a failure should
       be restructured to close any open log cursors it may have, and
       otherwise to retry the operation until it succeeds.  (Although the
       latter is not likely to be necessary; it is hard to imagine a reason to
       move or rename a log file in which transactions are being logged or
       aborted.)

       The db5.3_archive utility uses a Berkeley DB environment (as described
       for the -h option, the environment variable DB_HOME, or because the
       utility was run in a directory containing a Berkeley DB environment).
       In order to avoid environment corruption when using a Berkeley DB
       environment, db5.3_archive should always be given the chance to detach
       from the environment and exit gracefully.  To cause db5.3_archive to
       release all environment resources and exit cleanly, send it an
       interrupt signal (SIGINT).

       The DB_ENV->log_archive method is the underlying method used by the
       db5.3_archive utility.  See the db5.3_archive utility source code for
       an example of using DB_ENV->log_archive in a IEEE/ANSI Std 1003.1
       (POSIX) environment.

       The db5.3_archive utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error
       occurs.

ENVIRONMENT
       DB_HOME
	      If the -h option is not specified and the environment variable
	      DB_HOME is set, it is used as the path of the database home, as
	      described in DB_ENV->open.
