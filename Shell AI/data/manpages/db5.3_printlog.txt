NAME
       db5.3_printlog - Dumps Berkeley DB log files in a human-readable format

SYNOPSIS
       db5.3_printlog [-NrV] [-b start-LSN] [-e stop-LSN] [-h home] [-P
       password]

DESCRIPTION
       The db5.3_printlog utility is a debugging utility that dumps Berkeley
       DB log files in a human-readable format.

OPTIONS
       -b     Display log records starting at log sequence number (LSN) start-
	      LSN; start-LSN is specified as a file number, followed by a
	      slash (/) character, followed by an offset number, with no
	      intervening whitespace.

       -e     Stop displaying log records at log sequence number (LSN) stop-
	      LSN; stop-LSN is specified as a file number, followed by a slash
	      (/) character, followed by an offset number, with no intervening
	      whitespace.

       -h     Specify a home directory for the database environment; by
	      default, the current working directory is used.

       -N     Do not acquire shared region mutexes while running.  Other
	      problems, such as potentially fatal errors in Berkeley DB, will
	      be ignored as well.  This option is intended only for debugging
	      errors, and should not be used under any other circumstances.

       -P     Specify an environment password.	Although Berkeley DB utilities
	      overwrite password strings as soon as possible, be aware there
	      may be a window of vulnerability on systems where unprivileged
	      users can see command-line arguments or where utilities are not
	      able to overwrite the memory containing the command-line
	      arguments.

       -r     Read the log files in reverse order.

       -V     Write the library version number to the standard output, and
	      exit.

       The db5.3_printlog utility uses a Berkeley DB environment (as described
       for the -h option, the environment variable DB_HOME, or because the
       utility was run in a directory containing a Berkeley DB environment).
       In order to avoid environment corruption when using a Berkeley DB
       environment, db5.3_printlog should always be given the chance to detach
       from the environment and exit gracefully.  To cause db5.3_printlog to
       release all environment resources and exit cleanly, send it an
       interrupt signal (SIGINT).

       The db5.3_printlog utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error
       occurs.

ENVIRONMENT
       DB_HOME
	      If the -h option is not specified and the environment variable
	      DB_HOME is set, it is used as the path of the database home, as
	      described in DB_ENV->open.
