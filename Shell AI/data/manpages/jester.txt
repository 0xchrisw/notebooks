NAME
       jester - an X-based game similar to Othello(tm)

SYNOPSIS
       jester [{-display, -d, --display} display] [{-h, -help, --help}]
       [-2players] [-ai {white, black}]

DESCRIPTION
       jester is an X-based game similar to the board game Othello.  jester
       allows you to waste hours of otherwise productive time that could be
       spent playing Solitaire instead.

GAME PLAY
       There are two players, one playing the white pieces, the other playing
       the black pieces.  Each player takes turns placing a piece of his or
       her color on an 8x8 board.  Each piece must be placed so as to bracket
       a line of the opponent's pieces between two of the current player's
       pieces.	When this happens, the opponent's pieces are replaced by
       pieces of the current player's color.

       When the cursor is over a square that it is legal for the current
       player to play in, the cursor will change to a pointing hand.  A small
       rectangle in the upper right side of the window shows the color of the
       current player.

       The game ends when a player cannot make a move, either because the
       board is full or because the position of the pieces makes it impossible
       to make a move.	At this point, the player with the most pieces on the
       board is the winner.  You will be offered the option of starting a new
       game.

       You may exit at any time by clicking the “Exit” button.
