NAME
       tilda - a highly configurable terminal emulator

DESCRIPTION
       Tilda is a terminal emulator which is highly configurable. The main
       distinguishing feature of tilda is that it uses a configurable shortcut
       to show and hide the tilda window. This allows users to quickly switch
       between tilda and other windows only through keyboard shortcuts. When
       tilda is hidden it will move outside of the screen until a shortcut is
       pressed again to show the tilda window. The behaviour of tilda can be
       configured using the preferences dialog that is available via the
       context menu. A subset of the options can also be configured from the
       command line as documented below.

       Please note that currently command line options override the settings
       in the configuration file and are persisted into the configuration
       file.

       Tilda is currently not officially supported on Wayland. Starting with
       Tilda 1.5.0 it will be able to start under Wayland but the pull hotkey
       will only work from other X11 windows but not when a native Wayland
       window has the focus.
