NAME
       ansible-lint - lint tool for Ansible playbooks

SYNOPSIS
       ansible-lint [-M module_path] [-l] [-s] [module...]

DESCRIPTION
       ansible-lint checks Ansible playbooks for practices and behaviour that
       could potentially be improved.

OPTIONS
       --version:

       show program’s version number and exit

       -M DIRECTORY, --module-path=DIRECTORY
	   the DIRECTORY search path to load modules from. The default is
	   /usr/share/ansible. This can also be set with the ANSIBLE_LIBRARY
	   environment variable.

       -s, --snippet=
	   Produce a snippet which can be copied into a playbook for
	   modification, like a kind of task template.

       -l, --list=
	   Produce a terse listing of modules and a short description of each.

       -h, --help
	   show this help message and exit

       -L
	   list all the rules

       -q
	   quieter, although not silent output

       -p
	   parseable output in the format of pep8

       -r RULESDIR
	   specify one or more rules directories using one or more -r
	   arguments. Any -r flags override the default rules in
	   /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/ansiblelint/rules, unless -R is also
	   used.

       -R
	   Use default rules in
	   /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/ansiblelint/rules in addition to any
	   extra rules directories specified with -r. There is no need to
	   specify this if no -r flags are used

       -t TAGS
	   only check rules whose id/tags match these values

       -T
	   list all the tags

       -v
	   Increase verbosity level

       -x SKIP_LIST
	   only check rules whose id/tags do not match these values

       --nocolor
	   disable colored output

       --force-color
	   Try force colored output (relying on ansible’s code)

       --exclude=EXCLUDE_PATHS
	   path to directories or files to skip. This option is repeatable.
