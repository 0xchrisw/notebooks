ZGENHOSTID(8)		    System Manager's Manual		 ZGENHOSTID(8)

NAME
     zgenhostid â€” generate and store a hostid in /etc/hostid

SYNOPSIS
     zgenhostid [hostid]

DESCRIPTION
     If /etc/hostid does not exist, create it and store a hostid in it.  If
     the user provides [hostid] on the command line, store that value.
     Otherwise, randomly generate a value to store.

     This emulates the genhostid(1) utility and is provided for use on systems
     which do not include the utility.

OPTIONS
     [hostid] Specifies the value to be placed in /etc/hostid.	It must be a
     number with a value between 1 and 2^32-1.	This value must be unique
     among your systems.  It must be expressed in hexadecimal and be exactly 8
     digits long.

EXAMPLES
     Generate a random hostid and store it

	     # zgenhostid

     Record the libc-generated hostid in /etc/hostid

	     # zgenhostid $(hostid)

     Record a custom hostid (0xdeadbeef) in etc/hostid

	     # zgenhostid deadbeef
