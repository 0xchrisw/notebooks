NAME
       bogotune - find optimum parameter settings for bogofilter

SYNOPSIS
       bogotune [-v] [-c config] [-C] [-d dir] [-D] [-r value] [-T value]
		-n okfile [[-n] okfile [...]]
		-s spamfile [[-s] spamfile [...]] [-M file]

       bogotune [-h]

DESCRIPTION
       Bogotune tries to find optimum parameter settings for bogofilter. It
       needs at least one set each of spam and non-spam messages. The
       production wordlist is normally used, but it can be directed to read a
       different wordlist, or to build its own from half the supplied
       messages.

       In order to produce useful results, bogotune has minimum message count
       requirements. The wordlist it uses must have at least 2,000 spam and
       2,000 non-spam in it and the message files must contain at least 500
       spam and 500 non-spam messages. Also, the ratio of spam to non-spam
       should be in the range 0.2 to 5. If you direct bogotune to build its
       own wordlist, it will use the half the input or 2000 messages
       (whichever is larger) for the wordlist.

       Message files may be in mbox, maildir, or MH folder or any combination.
       Msg-count files can also be used, but not mixed with other formats.

OPTIONS
       The -h option prints the help message and exits.

       The -v option increases the verbosity level. Level 1 displays the scan
       output in detail instead of using a progress meter.

       The -c filename option tells bogofilter to read the config file named.

       The -C option prevents bogotune from reading a configuration file.

       The -d dir option specifies the directory for the database. See the
       ENVIRONMENT section for other directory setting options.

       The -D option tells bogotune to build a wordlist in memory using the
       input messages. The messages are read and divided into two groups. The
       first group is used to build a wordlist (in ram) and the second is used
       for tuning. To meet the minimum requirements of 2000 messages in the
       wordlist and 500 messages for testing, when -D is used, there must be
       2500 non-spam and 2500 spam in the input files. If there are enough
       messages (more than 4000), they will be split evenly between wordlist
       and testing. Otherwise, they will be split proportionately.

       The -n option tells bogotune that the following argument is a file (or
       folder) containing non-spam. Since version 1.0.3, multiple arguments to
       the -n option can be given. All non-option arguments until the next -s
       option will be treated as though they had been preceded by -n

       The -s option tells bogotune that the following argument is a file (or
       folder) containing spam. It can be repeated as often as necessary.
       Since version 1.0.3, multiple arguments to the -s can be given. All
       non-option arguments until the next -n option will be treated as though
       they had been preceded by -s.

       The -r value option tells bogotune to use the following parameter as
       the robx value.

       The -T value option tells bogotune to use the following parameter as fp
       target value.

       The -M file option tells bogotune to convert the file to message count
       format. This format provides a sorted list of each message's unique
       tokens, along with their ham and spam counts. Sorting hides the sense
       of the messages quite effectively, thus protecting privacy. The
       message-count format allows bogotune and bogofilter to score messages
       quickly without needing the original token database.

ENVIRONMENT
       Bogofilter uses a database directory, which can be set in the config
       file. If not set there, bogofilter will use the value of
       BOGOFILTER_DIR. Both can be overridden by the -ddir option. If none of
       that is available, bogofilter will use directory $HOME/.bogofilter.

BUGS
       Bogotune is not particularly robust when presented with garbage input.
