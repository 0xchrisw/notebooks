NAME
       mate-eiciel - MATE ACL file permissions editor

SYNOPSIS
       mate-eiciel

DESCRIPTION
       mate-eiciel is a graphical editor of file ACLs for the GNOME
       environment. In order to do something useful with it, you will need ACL
       support in your system and in your filesystems.

       Currently only Linux 2.6 (or a patched 2.4, see below) and FreeBSD 5.x
       are supported.  Maybe in the future other systems may be supported as
       well.

       mate-eiciel also adds a page in the Caja file properties dialog that
       you can reach by right-clicking over a file.

BUGS
       Don't doubt to report bugs to the author :)
