DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents how to run Telegram Desktop, official
       Telegram client.

OPTIONS
       Although the program is primarily a GUI application, it understands
       various command line arguments, some of them are described in the
       present document.

       -autostart
	      Apply automatic start. It works if only auto-starting is allowed
	      in settings and the app is not locked by a passcode. Telegram
	      will start minimized in the system tray if the corresponding
	      checkbox has been set.

       -startintray
	      Do not show the main window, just start in the system tray.
	      Useful for automatic unconditional launching.

       -cleanup
	      Remove an autostart shortcut effectively disabling the feature
	      then exit.

       -debug Run in debug mode immediately. See full logs in working
	      directory or in standard location at
	      ~/.local/share/TelegramDesktop/DebugLogs.

       -scale INT
	      Set initial interface scale factor. Possible values are measured
	      in percents from 75 up to 300 inclusive. The application
	      remembers last used value.

       -workdir PATH
	      Change current working directory to specified path before start.
	      All Telegram data will be stored encrypted in this folder. It
	      must exist before start. You can pass this option to partition
	      different app instances that run in parallel.

       URI    Specify Telegram link in tg:// scheme. Double dash is mandatory.
	      This is for opening chats by t.me site.

       There are also some other hidden options not intended for direct use.
